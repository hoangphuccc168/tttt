# What's happening to Azure Database for MariaDB?

Azure Database for MariaDB is on the retirement path, and **Azure Database for MariaDB is scheduled for retirement by September 19, 2025**.

As part of this retirement, there is no extended support for creating new MariaDB server instances from the Azure portal beginning **January 19, 2024**, if you still need to create MariaDB instances to meet business continuity needs, you can use [Azure CLI](/azure/mysql/single-server/quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-cli) until **March 19, 2024**.

We're investing in our flagship offering of Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server better suited for mission-critical workloads. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server has better features, performance, an improved architecture, and more controls to manage costs across all service tiers compared to Azure Database for MariaDB. We encourage you to migrate to Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server before retirement to experience the new capabilities of Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server.

Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server is a fully managed production-ready database service designed for more granular control and flexibility over database management functions and configuration settings.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q. Why is the Azure Database for MariaDB being retired?**

A. Azure Database for MariaDB became Generally Available (GA) in 2018. However, given customer feedback and new advancements in the computation, availability, scalability, and performance capabilities in the Azure database landscape, the MariaDB offering needs to be retired and upgraded with a new architecture â€“ Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server to bring you the best of Azure's open-source database platform.

**Q. Why am I being asked to migrate to Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server?**

A. There's a high application compatibility between Azure Database for MariaDB and Azure Database for MySQL, as MariaDB was forked from MySQL. [Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/mysql/flexible-server/#overview) is the best platform for running all your MySQL workloads on Azure. Azure MySQL- Flexible server is both economical and provides better performance across all service tiers and more ways to control your costs for cheaper and faster disaster recovery:

- More ways to optimize costs, including support for burstable tier compute options.

- Improved performance for business-critical production workloads that require low latency, high concurrency, fast failover, and high scalability.

- Improved uptime by configuring a hot standby on the same or a different zone and a one-hour time window for planned server maintenance.

**Q. How soon must I migrate my MariaDB servers to a flexible server?**

A. Azure Database for MariaDB is scheduled for retirement by **September 19, 2025**, so we strongly recommend migrating to Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server at your earliest opportunity to ensure ample time to run through the migration lifecycle, apply the benefits offered by Flexible Server, and ensure the continuity of your business.

A. Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible server zone-redundant deployment provides 99.99% availability with zonal-level resiliency, whereas MariaDB provides resiliency in a single availability zone. Flexible Server's High Availability (HA) architecture deploys a warm standby with redundant compute and storage (with each site's data stored in 3x copies) as compared to MariaDB's HA architecture, which doesn't have a passive hot standby to help recover from zonal failures. The flexible server's HA architecture enables reduced downtime during unplanned outages and planned maintenance.
