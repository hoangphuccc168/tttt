There are no licensing requirements for using managed identities for Azure resources. Managed identities is a feature of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that provides an automatically managed identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure AD authentication. One of the benefits of using managed identities is that you donâ€™t need to manage credentials, and they can be used at no extra cost. For more information, see [What is managed identities for Azure resources?](../managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).
