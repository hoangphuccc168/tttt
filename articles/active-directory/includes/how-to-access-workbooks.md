There are several prerequisites for accessing Microsoft Entra workbooks. You must have the appropriate Microsoft Entra *and* Azure Monitor roles. You must also have a Log Analytics workspace *and* access to that workspace. For more information, see [How to use Microsoft Entra workbooks](../reports-monitoring/howto-use-workbooks.md#prerequisites).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) using the appropriate combination of roles.
1. Browse to **Identity** > **Monitoring & health** > **Workbooks**.
