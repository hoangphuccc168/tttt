> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Azure AD PowerShell](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview) is planned for deprecation on **March 30, 2024**. For more details on the deprecation plans, see the [deprecation update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-new-feature-and-change-announcements/ba-p/3796396). We encourage you to continue migrating to [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview), which is the recommended module for interacting with Microsoft Entra ID. In addition, Microsoft Graph PowerShell allows you access to all Microsoft Graph APIs and is available on PowerShell 7. For more information, see [Upgrade from Azure AD PowerShell to Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/migration-steps).
