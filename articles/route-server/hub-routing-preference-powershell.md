# Configure routing preference to influence route selection using PowerShell

Learn how to use routing preference setting in Azure Route Server to influence its route learning and selection. For more information, see [Routing preference (preview)](hub-routing-preference.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Routing preference is currently in PREVIEW. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An Azure route server. If you need to create a Route Server, see [Create and configure Azure Route Server](quickstart-configure-route-server-powershell.md).
- Azure Cloud Shell or Azure PowerShell installed locally.

## View routing preference configuration

Use [Get-AzRouteServer](/powershell/module/az.network/get-azrouteserver) to view the current routing preference configuration.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Get the Route Server.
Get-AzRouteServer -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup'
```

In the output, you can see the current routing preference setting under **HubRoutingPreference**:

```output
ResourceGroupName Name          Location RouteServerAsn RouteServerIps       ProvisioningState HubRoutingPreference
----------------- ----          -------- -------------- --------------       ----------------- --------------------
myResourceGroup   myRouteServer eastus   65515          {10.1.1.5, 10.1.1.4} Succeeded         ExpressRoute
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default routing preference setting is **ExpressRoute**.

## Configure routing preference

Use [Update-AzRouteServer](/powershell/module/az.network/update-azrouteserver) to configure routing preference.

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Change the routing preference to AS Path.
Update-AzRouteServer -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer' -HubRoutingPreference 'ASPath' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup'
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Change the routing preference to VPN Gateway.
Update-AzRouteServer -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer' -HubRoutingPreference 'VpnGateway' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup'
```

```azurepowershell-interactive
# Change the routing preference to ExpressRoute.
Update-AzRouteServer -RouteServerName 'myRouteServer' -HubRoutingPreference 'ExpressRoute' -ResourceGroupName 'myResourceGroup'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Include ***-AllowBranchToBranchTraffic*** parameter to enable **route exchange (branch-to-branch)** even if it was enabled before running the **Update-AzRouteServer** cmdlet. For more information, see [Configure route exchange](quickstart-configure-route-server-powershell.md#configure-route-exchange).
