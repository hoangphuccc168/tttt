# What is Azure Operator Service Manager?

Azure Operator Service Manager is an Azure service designed to assist telecom operators in managing their network services. It provides management capabilities for multi-vendor applications across hybrid cloud sites, encompassing Azure regions, edge platforms, and Arc-connected sites. Azure Operator Service Manager caters to the needs of telecom operators who are in the process of migrating their workloads to Azure and Arc-connected cloud environments.

## Orchestrate operator services across Azure platforms

As part of the Azure AI Operations program, Azure Operator Service Manager transforms the traditional operator service management experience into a modern cloud service. With support for Azure For Operator platforms, like Azure Operator Nexus and services like Azure Operator 5G Core, operators can simplify complex service deployments. This simplification ensures carrier grade service reliability while accelerating both service innovation and service monetization.

## Technical overview

Managing complex network services efficiently and reliably can be a challenge.  Azure Operator Service Manager’s unique role-based approach introduces curated experiences for publishers, designers and operators.  Use of Network Service Design (NSD) artifacts to onboard service requirements and configuration group schemas/values to define run-time inputs. The following diagram illustrates the Azure Operator Service Manager (AOSM) deployment workflow.

## Product features

### Support Azure Operator Nexus platform and service catalog

Manage lifecycle for next generation services on Azure Operator Nexus platform. Manage lifecycle includes self-service support for telecom operators to onboard and deploy third-party network services along with catalog offerings from industry leaders such as Ericsson and Nokia and Microsoft’s own Azure For Operator services.

### Unified service orchestration

Consolidate software and configuration management tasks into a single set of end-to-end Azure operations to seamlessly compose, deploy, and update complex multi-vendor multi-region services. One true Azure interface provides access to all operator service management needs.

### Simplify service creation

Model network services using Azure Resource Manager (ARM), just like any other Azure resources.  Reduce the number of parameters needed to create operator-centric services and drive run-time operations via traditional Azure interfaces, such as portal, CLI, API or SDK.

### Reliably deploy Telco grade network function software

Operators can easily automate repeat configuration changes, reducing the effort required to ensure service consistency and enhancing the reliability of service deployments.

### Secure software distribution supply chain

World class software distribution security addresses operator concerns with the threat of bad actors.  Use of modern custody management ensures what a publisher has on-boarded, is what an operator deploys.

### Consistent service updates

Updating services becomes straightforward. Operators can recall the last service template, modify service parameters, and request a new service deployment. Using convergence to reach the desired state makes service updates seamless. Furthermore, if necessary, operators can easily clean up and delete service instances.

## Business impact

### Accelerate service velocity

Leverage Azure Operator Service manager’s approach to service composition, deployment and updates, to realize up to a 3x acceleration of service velocity. This allows operators to increase the frequency of services updates and be first to market with new services.

### Optimize capital expenses

Ease the path to Azure cloud savings with on-demand placement of service resources.  Operators can realize up to a 40% reduction in capital expenses, by breaking the traditional cycle of advanced capacity purchasing.

### Reduce energy expense

Steer service placement to the greenest hardware, reducing service operating expenses by up to 20%. Use of greenest hardware also helps shrink the overall corporate carbon footprint.

## Conclusion

By unifying service management, facilitating reliable deployments, supporting global workflows, and ensuring service consistency, operators can achieve accelerated service velocity, improved service reliability, and optimize service cost. Harness the power of Microsoft Azure to drive network services forward.
