# Azure OpenAI Service REST API reference

This article provides details on the inference REST API endpoints for Azure OpenAI.

## Authentication

Azure OpenAI provides two methods for authentication. you can use  either API Keys or Microsoft Entra ID.

- **API Key authentication**: For this type of authentication, all API requests must include the API Key in the ```api-key``` HTTP header. The [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) provides guidance for how to make calls with this type of authentication.

- **Microsoft Entra authentication**: You can authenticate an API call using a Microsoft Entra token. Authentication tokens are included in a request as the ```Authorization``` header. The token provided must be preceded by ```Bearer```, for example ```Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN```. You can read our how-to guide on [authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID](./how-to/managed-identity.md).

### REST API versioning

The service APIs are versioned using the ```api-version``` query parameter. All versions follow the YYYY-MM-DD date structure. For example:

```http
POST https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/completions?api-version=2023-05-15
```

## Completions

With the Completions operation, the model will generate one or more predicted completions based on a provided prompt. The service can also return the probabilities of alternative tokens at each position.

**Create a completion**

```http
POST https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/completions?api-version={api-version}
```

**Path parameters**

**Request body**

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ```prompt``` | string or array | Optional | ```<\|endoftext\|>``` | The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, or array of strings. Note that ```<\|endoftext\|>``` is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt isn't specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document. |
| ```max_tokens``` | integer | Optional | 16 | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens can't exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096). |
| ```temperature``` | number | Optional | 1 | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values means the model will take more risks. Try 0.9 for more creative applications, and 0 (`argmax sampling`) for ones with a well-defined answer. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both. |
| ```top_p``` | number | Optional | 1 | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both. |
| ```logit_bias``` | map | Optional | null | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the <\|endoftext\|> token from being generated. |
| ```user``` | string | Optional | | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help monitoring and detecting abuse |
| ```n``` | integer | Optional |  1 | How many completions to generate for each prompt. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. |
| ```stream``` | boolean | Optional | False | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message.| 
| ```logprobs``` | integer | Optional | null | Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 10, the API will return a list of the 10 most likely tokens. the API will always return the logprob of the sampled token, so there might be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response. This parameter cannot be used with `gpt-35-turbo`. |
| ```suffix```| string | Optional | null | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text. |
| ```echo``` | boolean | Optional | False | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion. This parameter cannot be used with `gpt-35-turbo`. |
| ```stop``` | string or array | Optional | null | Up to four sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence. |
| ```presence_penalty``` | number | Optional | 0 | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
| ```frequency_penalty``` | number | Optional | 0 | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. |
| ```best_of``` | integer | Optional | 1 | Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the lowest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return â€“ best_of must be greater than n. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop. This parameter cannot be used with `gpt-35-turbo`. |

#### Example request

```console
curl https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/completions?api-version=2023-05-15\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d "{
  \"prompt\": \"Once upon a time\",
  \"max_tokens\": 5
}"
```

#### Example response

```json
{
    "id": "cmpl-4kGh7iXtjW4lc9eGhff6Hp8C7btdQ",
    "object": "text_completion",
    "created": 1646932609,
    "model": "ada",
    "choices": [
        {
            "text": ", a dark line crossed",

            "logprobs": null,
            "finish_reason": "length"
        }
    ]
}
```

In the example response, `finish_reason` equals `stop`. If `finish_reason` equals `content_filter` consult our [content filtering guide](./concepts/content-filter.md) to understand why this is occurring.

## Embeddings

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| ```messages``` | array | Required |  | The collection of context messages associated with this chat completions request. Typical usage begins with a [chat message](#chatmessage) for the System role that provides instructions for the behavior of the assistant, followed by alternating messages between the User and Assistant roles.|
| ```temperature```| number | Optional | 1 | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.\nWe generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. |
| ```n``` | integer | Optional | 1 | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message.  |
| ```stream``` | boolean | Optional | false | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message." |
| ```stop``` | string or array | Optional | null | Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.|
| ```max_tokens``` | integer | Optional | inf | The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return will be (4096 - prompt tokens).|
| ```presence_penalty``` | number | Optional | 0 | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.|
| ```frequency_penalty``` | number | Optional | 0 | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.|
| ```logit_bias``` | object | Optional | null | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.|
| ```user``` | string | Optional | | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Azure OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse.|
|```function_call```|  | Optional | | Controls how the model responds to function calls. "none" means the model does not call a function, and responds to the end-user. "auto" means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function. "none" is the default when no functions are present. "auto" is the default if functions are present. This parameter requires API version [`2023-07-01-preview`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/cognitiveservices/data-plane/AzureOpenAI/inference/preview/2023-07-01-preview/generated.json) |
|```functions``` | [`FunctionDefinition[]`](#functiondefinition) | Optional | | A list of functions the model can generate JSON inputs for. This parameter requires API version [`2023-07-01-preview`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/main/specification/cognitiveservices/data-plane/AzureOpenAI/inference/preview/2023-07-01-preview/generated.json)|

| `temperature` | number | Optional | 0 | 	What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. |
| `top_p` | number | Optional | 1 |An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.|
| `stream` | boolean | Optional | false | If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a message `"messages": [{"delta": {"content": "[DONE]"}, "index": 2, "end_turn": true}]`  |
| `stop` | string or array | Optional | null | Up to 2 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. |
| `max_tokens` | integer | Optional | 1000 | 	The maximum number of tokens allowed for the generated answer. By default, the number of tokens the model can return is `4096 - prompt_tokens`.  |

The following parameters can be used inside of the `parameters` field inside of `dataSources`.

|  Parameters | Type | Required? | Default | Description |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| `type` | string | Required | null | The data source to be used for the Azure OpenAI on your data feature. For Azure Cognitive search the value is `AzureCognitiveSearch`. |
| `endpoint` | string | Required | null | The data source endpoint. |
| `key` | string | Required | null | One of the Azure Cognitive Search admin keys for your service. |
| `indexName` | string | Required | null | The search index to be used. |
| `fieldsMapping` | dictionary | Optional | null | Index data column mapping.   |
| `inScope` | boolean | Optional | true | If set, this value will limit responses specific to the grounding data content.  |
| `topNDocuments` | number | Optional | 5 | Specifies the number of top-scoring documents from your data index used to generate responses. You might want to increase the value when you have short documents or want to provide more context. This is the *retrieved documents* parameter in Azure OpenAI studio.   |
| `queryType` | string | Optional | simple |  Indicates which query option will be used for Azure Cognitive Search. Available types: `simple`, `semantic`, `vector`, `vectorSimpleHybrid`, `vectorSemanticHybrid`. |
| `semanticConfiguration` | string | Optional | null |  The semantic search configuration. Only required when `queryType` is set to `semantic` or  `vectorSemanticHybrid`.  |
| `roleInformation` | string | Optional | null |  Gives the model instructions about how it should behave and the context it should reference when generating a response. Corresponds to the "System Message" in Azure OpenAI Studio. See [Using your data](./concepts/use-your-data.md#system-message) for more information. Thereâ€™s a 100 token limit, which counts towards the overall token limit.|
| `filter` | string | Optional | null | The filter pattern used for [restricting access to sensitive documents](./concepts/use-your-data.md#document-level-access-control)
| `embeddingEndpoint` | string | Optional | null | The endpoint URL for an Ada embedding model deployment, generally of the format `https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME/embeddings?api-version=2023-05-15`. Use with the `embeddingKey` parameter  for [vector search](./concepts/use-your-data.md#search-options) outside of private networks and private endpoints. | 
| `embeddingKey` | string | Optional | null | The API key for an Ada embedding model deployment. Use with `embeddingEndpoint` for [vector search](./concepts/use-your-data.md#search-options) outside of private networks and private endpoints. | 
| `embeddingDeploymentName` | string | Optional | null | The Ada embedding model deployment name within the same Azure OpenAI resource. Used instead of `embeddingEndpoint` and `embeddingKey` for [vector search](./concepts/use-your-data.md#search-options). Should only be used when both the `embeddingEndpoint` and `embeddingKey` parameters are defined. When this parameter is provided, Azure OpenAI on your data will use an internal call to evaluate the Ada embedding model, rather than calling  the Azure OpenAI endpoint. This enables you to use vector search in private networks and private endpoints. Billing remains the same whether this parameter is defined or not. Available in regions where embedding models are [available](./concepts/models.md#embeddings-models) starting in API versions `2023-06-01-preview` and later.|
| `strictness` | number | Optional | 3 | Sets the threshold to categorize documents as relevant to your queries. Raising the value means a higher threshold for relevance and filters out more less-relevant documents for responses. Setting this value too high might cause the model to fail to generate responses due to limited available documents. |
