## Add your data using Azure OpenAI Studio

Navigate to [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign-in with credentials that have access to your Azure OpenAI resource. During or after the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

1. Select the **Chat playground** tile.

1. In the pane that appears, select **Upload files** under **Select data source**. Select **Upload files**. Azure OpenAI needs both a storage resource and a search resource to access and index your data.

    > [!TIP]
    > * See the following resource for more information:
    >    * [Data source options](../concepts/use-your-data.md#data-source-options)
    >    * [supported file types and formats](../concepts/use-your-data.md#data-formats-and-file-types)
    > *  For documents and datasets with long text, we recommend using the available [data preparation script](../concepts/use-your-data.md#ingesting-your-data-into-azure-cognitive-search). 

    1. For Azure OpenAI to access your storage account, you will need to turn on [Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2237228). If CORS isn't already turned on for the Azure Blob storage resource, select **Turn on CORS**. 

    1. Select your Azure Cognitive Search resource, and select the acknowledgment that connecting it will incur usage on your account. Then select **Next**.

1. On the **Upload files** pane, select **Browse for a file** and select the files you want to upload. Then select **Upload files**. Then select **Next**.

1. On the **Data management** pane, you can choose whether to enable [semantic search or vector search](../concepts/use-your-data.md#search-options) for your index.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > * Semantic search and vector search are subject to [additional pricing](../concepts/use-your-data.md#search-options).
    >    * You can use *keyword* search as the search type for no additional cost.
    > * To enable vector search, you will need a `text-embedding-ada-002` deployment in your Azure OpenAI resource.
    > * Currently Azure OpenAI on your data supports semantic search for English data only. Only enable semantic search if both your documents and use case are in English.
    
1. Review the details you entered, and select **Save and close**. You can now chat with the model and it will use information from your data to construct the response.
