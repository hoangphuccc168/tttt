# Customize a model with fine-tuning (preview)

Azure OpenAI Service lets you tailor our models to your personal datasets by using a process known as *fine-tuning*. This customization step lets you get more out of the service by providing:

- Higher quality results than what you can get just from [prompt engineering](../concepts/prompt-engineering.md)
- The ability to train on more examples than can fit into a model's max request context limit.
- Lower-latency requests, particularly when using smaller models.

A fine-tuned model improves on the few-shot learning approach by training the model's weights on your own data. A customized model lets you achieve better results on a wider number of tasks without needing to provide examples in your prompt. The result is less text sent and fewer tokens processed on every API call, potentially saving cost and improving request latency.
