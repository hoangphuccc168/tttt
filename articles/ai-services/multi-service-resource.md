# Quickstart: Create a multi-service resource for Azure AI services

Use this quickstart to create and manage a multi-service resource for Azure AI services. A multi-service resource allows you to access multiple Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint. It also consolidates billing from the services you use.

You can access Azure AI services through two different resources: A multi-service resource, or a single-service one.

* Multi-service resource:
    * Access multiple Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint.
    * Consolidates billing from the services you use.
* Single-service resource:
    * Access a single Azure AI service with a unique key and endpoint for each service created. 
    * Most Azure AI services offer a free tier to try it out.

Azure AI services are represented by Azure [resources](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal.md) that you create under your Azure subscription. After you create a resource, you can use the keys and endpoint generated to authenticate your applications.

## Supported services with a multi-service resource

The multi-service resource enables access to the following Azure AI services with a single key and endpoint. Use these links to find quickstart articles, samples, and more to start using your resource.
