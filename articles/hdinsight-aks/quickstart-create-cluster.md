# Create cluster pool and cluster

[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]

HDInsight on AKS has the concept of cluster pools and clusters.

- **Cluster pools** are a logical grouping of clusters and maintain a set of clusters in the same pool, which helps in building robust interoperability across multiple cluster types. It can be created within an existing virtual network or outside a virtual network.

  A cluster pool in HDInsight on AKS corresponds to one cluster in AKS infrastructure.

- **Clusters** are individual compute workloads, such as Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Trino, which can be created in the same cluster pool.

For creating Apache Spark, Apache Flink, or Trino clusters, you need to first create a cluster pool.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have completed the [subscription prerequisites](prerequisites-subscription.md) and [resource prerequisites](prerequisites-resources.md) before creating a cluster pool.

## Create a cluster pool

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
   
1. In the Azure portal search bar, type "HDInsight on AKS cluster pool" and select "Azure HDInsight on AKS cluster pools" from the drop-down list.

1. Click **+ Create**.

     |Pool name| Enter the name of the cluster pool to be created. Cluster pool name length can't be more than 26 characters. It must start with an alphabet, end with an alphanumeric character, and must only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphens.|
     |Region|From the drop-down list, select the region for the cluster pool. Check [region availability](./overview.md#region-availability-public-preview). For cluster pools in a virtual network, the region for the virtual network and the cluster pool must be same. |
     |Cluster pool version|From the drop-down list, select the HDInsight on AKS cluster pool version. |
     |Virtual machine|From the drop-down list, select the virtual machine size for the cluster pool based on your requirement.|
     |Managed resource group|(Optional) Provide a name for managed resource group. It holds ancillary resources created by HDInsight on AKS.|
   

    Select **Next: Security + networking** to continue.
        
1. On the **Security + networking** page, provide the following information:
      
     :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/cluster-pool-security-tab.png" alt-text="Diagram showing cluster pool creation network and security tab." border="true" lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/cluster-pool-security-tab.png":::

    Select **Next: Integrations** to continue.
    
        
1. On the **Integrations** page, provide the following information:

      :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/create-cluster-pool-integration-tab.png" alt-text="Diagram showing cluster pool creation integration tab." border="true" lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/create-cluster-pool-integration-tab.png":::

     |Property|Description|
     |---|---|
     |Log Analytics| (Optional) Select this option to enable Log analytics to view insights and logs directly in your cluster by sending metrics and logs to a Log Analytics Workspace.|
     |Azure Prometheus| You can enable this option after cluster pool creation is completed. |
     
    Select **Next: Tags** to continue.
    
1. On the **Tags** page, enter any tags (optional) youâ€™d like to assign to the cluster pool.
   
     :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/create-cluster-pool-tags-page.png" alt-text="Diagram showing cluster pool creation tags tab." border="true" lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/create-cluster-pool-tags-page.png":::

     | Property | Description|
     |---|---|
     |Name | Enter a name (key) that help you identify resources based on settings that are relevant to your organization. For example, "Environment" to track the deployment environment for your resources.|

     | Resource | Select the applicable resource type.|

     Select **Next: Review + create** to continue.
     
1. On the **Review + create** page, look for the **Validation succeeded** message at the top of the page and then click **Create**.

     The **Deployment is in process** page is displayed while the cluster pool is being created, and the **Your deployment is complete page** is displayed once the cluster pool is fully deployed and ready for use.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/create-cluster-pool-review-create-page.png" alt-text="Diagram showing cluster pool review and create tab." lightbox="./media/quickstart-create-cluster/create-cluster-review-create-page.png"::: 

     If you navigate away from the page, you can check the status of the deployment by clicking Notifications icon.
    
     > [!TIP]
     > For troubleshooting any deployment errors, you can refer this [page](./create-cluster-error-dictionary.md).

## Create a cluster

Once the cluster pool deployment completes, continue to use the Azure portal to create a [Trino](./trino/trino-create-cluster.md#create-a-trino-cluster), [Flink](./flink/flink-create-cluster-portal.md#create-an-apache-flink-cluster), and [Spark](./spark/hdinsight-on-aks-spark-overview.md) cluster. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For creating a cluster in a new cluster pool, assign AKS agentpool MSI "Managed Identity Operator" role on the user-assigned managed identity created as part of resource prerequisites.
> When a user has permission to assign the Azure RBAC roles, it's assigned automatically.
> 
> AKS agentpool managed identity is created during cluster pool creation. You can identify the AKS agentpool managed identity by **(your clusterpool name)-agentpool**.
> Follow these steps to [assign the role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal#step-2-open-the-add-role-assignment-page).

For a quickstart, refer to the following steps.
