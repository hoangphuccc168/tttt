# What is Azure Operator Insights?

Azure Operator Insights is a fully managed service that enables the collection and analysis of massive quantities of network data gathered from complex multi-part or multi-vendor network functions. It delivers statistical, machine learning, and AI-based insights for operator-specific workloads to help operators understand the health of their networks and the quality of their subscribers' experiences in near real-time.

Azure Operator Insights accelerates time to business value by eliminating the pain and time-consuming task of assembling off-the-shelf cloud components (chemistry set). This reduces load on ultra-lean operator platform and data engineering teams by making the following turnkey: 
High scale ingestion to handle large amounts of network data from operator data sources. 

- Pipelines managed for all operators, leading to economies of scale dropping the price. 
- Operator privacy module. 
- Operator compliance including handling retention policies. 
- Common data model with open standards such as parquet and delta lake for easy integration with other Microsoft and third-party services. 
- High speed analytics to enable fast data exploration and correlation between different data sets produced by disaggregated 5G multi-vendor networks. 

The result is that the operator has a lower total cost of ownership but higher insights of their network over equivalent on-premises or cloud chemistry set platforms.
