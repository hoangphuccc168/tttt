The certificate(s) will be downloaded from the domain controller(s) automatically through the **PrimaryUrl** and/or **SecondaryUrl** parameters if the **SSLCertificatesSasUrl** parameter is not provided. You can still provide **SSLCertificatesSasUrl** and follow the optional steps to manually export and upload the certificate(s).

## Prerequisites

- Ensure your Active Directory network is connected to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.

- For AD authentication with LDAPS:

    - Obtain access to the Active Directory Domain Controller(s) with Administrator permissions.
    - Enable LDAPS on your Active Directory Domain Controller(s) with a valid certificate. You may obtain the certificate from an [Active Directory Certificate Services Certificate Authority (CA)](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2980.ldap-over-ssl-ldaps-certificate.aspx) or a [third-party/public CA](/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-ldap-over-ssl-3rd-certification-authority).
    - Follow the steps in [create a certificate for secure LDAP](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps.md#create-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap) to obtain a valid certificate. Ensure the certificate meets the listed requirements.
    > [!NOTE]
    > Avoid using self-signed certificates in production environments.  
    - Optional: If you don't provide the **SSLCertificatesSasUrl** parameter, the certificate(s) is automatically downloaded from the domain controller(s) through the **PrimaryUrl** and/or  **SecondaryUrl** parameters. Alternatively, you can manually [export the certificate for LDAPS authentication](#optional-export-the-certificate-for-ldaps-authentication) and upload it to an Azure Storage account as blob storage. Then, [grant access to Azure Storage resources using a shared access signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md).  

- Configure DNS resolution for Azure VMware Solution to your on-premises AD. Enable DNS Forwarder from the Azure portal. For more information, see [configure DNS forwarder for Azure VMware Solution](configure-dns-azure-vmware-solution.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Consult your security or identity management team for more information about LDAPS and certificate issuance.

## (Optional) Export the certificate for LDAPS authentication

First, verify that the certificate used for LDAPS is valid. If you don't have a certificate, follow the steps to [create a certificate for secure LDAP](../active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-configure-ldaps.md#create-a-certificate-for-secure-ldap) before continuing.

1. Sign in to a domain controller with administrator permissions where LDAPS is enabled.
1. Open the **Run command**, type **mmc**, and select **OK**.
1. Select **File** > **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
1. Choose **Certificates** from the list of Snap-ins and select **Add>**.
1. In the **Certificates snap-in** window, select **Computer account** and then select **Next**.
1. Keep **Local computer...** selected, select **Finish**, and then **OK**.
1. Expand the **Personal** folder under the **Certificates (Local Computer)** management console and select the **Certificates** folder to view the installed certificates.

1. Double-click the certificate for LDAPS purposes. Ensure the certificate date **Valid from** and **to** is current and the certificate has a **private key** that corresponds to the certificate.

    :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-personal-general.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the properties of the LDAPS certificate." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-personal-general.png":::

1. In the same window, select the **Certification Path** tab and verify that the **Certification path** is valid. It should include the certificate chain of root CA and optional intermediate certificates. Check that the **Certificate Status** is OK.

    :::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-cert-path.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the certificate chain in the Certification Path tab." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-certificate-cert-path.png":::

1. Close the window.

Next, export the certificate:

1. In the Certificates console, right-click the LDAPS certificate and select **All Tasks** > **Export**. The Certificate Export Wizard appears. Select **Next**.
1. In the **Export Private Key** section, choose **No, do not export the private key** and select **Next**.
1. In the **Export File Format** section, select **Base-64 encoded X.509(.CER)** and select **Next**.
1. In the **File to Export** section, select **Browse...**, choose a folder location to export the certificate, enter a name, and select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> If more than one domain controller is LDAPS enabled, repeat the export procedure for each additional domain controller to export their corresponding certificates. Note that you can only reference two LDAPS servers in the `New-LDAPSIdentitySource` Run Command. If the certificate is a wildcard certificate, such as ***.avsdemo.net**, you only need to export the certificate from one of the domain controllers.

## (Optional) Upload the LDAPS certificate to blob storage and generate a SAS URL

- Upload the certificate file (.cer format) you just exported to an Azure Storage account as blob storage. Then, [grant access to Azure Storage resources using a shared access signature (SAS)](../storage/common/storage-sas-overview.md).

- If you need multiple certificates, upload each one individually and generate a SAS URL for each.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to copy all SAS URL strings, as they won't be accessible once you leave the page.

> [!TIP]
> An alternative method for consolidating certificates involves storing all the certificate chains in one file, as detailed in [this VMware KB article](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2041378). Then, generate a single SAS URL for the file that contains all the certificates.

## Configure NSX-T DNS for Active Directory domain resolution

Create a DNS zone and add it to the DNS service. Follow the instructions in [configure a DNS forwarder in the Azure portal](./configure-dns-azure-vmware-solution.md).

After completing these steps, verify that your DNS service includes your DNS zone.

:::image type="content" source="media/run-command/ldaps-dns-zone-service-configured.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the DNS service with the required DNS zone included." lightbox="media/run-command/ldaps-dns-zone-service-configured.png":::

Your Azure VMware Solution private cloud should now properly resolve your on-premises Active Directory domain name.

## Add Active Directory over LDAP with SSL

To add AD over LDAP with SSL as an external identity source to use with SSO into vCenter Server, run the `New-LDAPSIdentitySource` cmdlet:

1. Navigate to your Azure VMware Solution private cloud and select **Run command** > **Packages** > **New-LDAPSIdentitySource**.

1. Provide the required values or modify the default values, and then select **Run**.
