# Recover from accidental deletion of resource bridge virtual machine

In this article, you'll learn how to recover the Azure Arc resource bridge (preview) connection into a working state in disaster scenarios such as accidental deletion. In such cases, the connection between on-premises infrastructure and Azure is lost and any operations performed through Arc will fail.

## Recover the Arc resource bridge in case of virtual machine deletion

To recover from Arc resource bridge VM deletion, you need to deploy a new resource bridge with the same resource ID as the current resource bridge using the following steps.

1. Copy the Azure region and resource IDs of the Arc resource bridge, custom location, and SCVMM Azure resources.

2. Find and delete the old Arc resource bridge resource under the [Resource Bridges tab from the Azure Arc center](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_HybridCompute/AzureArcCenterBlade/~/resourceBridges).

3. Download the [onboarding script](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc#download-the-onboarding-script) from the Azure portal and update the following section in the script, using the same information as the original resources in Azure.

    ```powershell
    $location = <Azure region of the resources>
    $applianceSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $applianceResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $applianceName = <resource-bridge-name>

    $customLocationSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $customLocationResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $customLocationName = <custom-location-name>

    $vmmserverSubscriptionId = <subscription-id>
    $vmmserverResourceGroupName = <resource-group-name>
    $vmmserverName= <SCVMM-name-in-azure>
    ```

4. [Run the onboarding script](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc#download-the-onboarding-script) again with the `--force` parameter.

    ``` powershell-interactive
    ./resource-bridge-onboarding-script.ps1 --force
    ```

5. [Provide the inputs](/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/quickstart-connect-system-center-virtual-machine-manager-to-arc#script-runtime) as prompted.

6. In the same machine, run the following scripts, as applicable:
     - [Download the script](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/b/4/6b4a5009-fed8-46c2-b22b-b24a4d0a06e3/arcvmm-appliance-dr.ps1) if you are running the script from a Windows machine
     - [Download the script](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/5/c/05c2bcb8-87f8-4ead-9757-a87a0759071c/arcvmm-appliance-dr.sh) if you are running the script from a Linux machine

7. Once the script is run successfully, the old Resource Bridge will be recovered and the connection is re-established to the existing Azure-enabled SCVMM resources.
