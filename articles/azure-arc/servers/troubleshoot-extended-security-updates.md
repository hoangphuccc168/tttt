# Troubleshoot delivery of Extended Security Updates for Windows Server 2012

This article provides information on troubleshooting and resolving issues that may occur while [enabling Extended Security Updates for Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 through Arc-enabled servers](deliver-extended-security-updates.md).

## License provisioning issues

If you're unable to provision a Windows Server 2012 Extended Security Update license for Azure Arc-enabled servers, check the following:

- **Permissions:** Verify you have sufficient permissions (Contributor role or higher) within the scope of ESU provisioning and linking.  

- **Core minimums:** Verify you have specified sufficient cores for the ESU License. Physical core-based licenses require a minimum of 16 cores, and virtual core-based licenses require a minimum of 8 cores per virtual machine (VM). 

- **Conventions:** Verify you have selected an appropriate subscription and resource group and provided a unique name for the ESU license.     

## ESU enrollment issues

If you're unable to successfully link your Azure Arc-enabled server to an activated Extended Security Updates license, verify the following conditions are met:

- **Connectivity:** Azure Arc-enabled server is **Connected**. For information about viewing the status of Azure Arc-enabled machines, see [Agent status](overview.md#agent-status).

- **Agent version:** Connected Machine agent is version 1.34 or higher. If the agent version is less than 1.34, you need to update it to this version or higher.

- **Operating system:** Only Azure Arc-enabled servers running the Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 operating system are eligible to enroll in Extended Security Updates.

- **Environment:** The connected machine should not be running on Azure Stack HCI, Azure VMware solution, or as an Azure virtual machine. In these scenarios, WS2012 ESUs are available for free. For information about no-cost ESUs through Azure Stack HCI, see [Free Extended Security Updates through Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/manage/azure-benefits-esu?tabs=windows-server-2012).

- **License properties:** Verify the license is activated and has been allocated sufficient physical or virtual cores to support the intended scope of servers.

## ESU patches issues

If you have issues receiving ESUs after successfully enrolling the server through Arc-enabled servers, or you need additional information related to issues affecting ESU deployment, see [Troubleshoot issues in ESU](/troubleshoot/windows-client/windows-7-eos-faq/troubleshoot-extended-security-updates-issues).
