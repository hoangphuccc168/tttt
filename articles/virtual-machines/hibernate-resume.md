# Hibernating virtual machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Virtual Machines - Hibernation is currently in PREVIEW.
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

Hibernation allows you to pause VMs that aren't being used and save on compute costs. It's an effective cost management feature for scenarios such as:
- Virtual desktops, dev/test, and other scenarios where the VMs don't need to run 24/7.
- Systems with long boot times due to memory intensive applications. These applications can be initialized on VMs and hibernated. These “prewarmed” VMs can then be quickly started when needed, with the applications already up and running in the desired state.

## How hibernation works

When you hibernate a VM, Azure signals the VM's operating system to perform a suspend-to-disk action. Azure stores the memory contents of the VM in the OS disk, then deallocates the VM. When the VM is started again, the memory contents are transferred from the OS disk back into memory. Applications and processes that were previously running in your VM resume from the state prior to hibernation.

Once a VM is in a hibernated state, you aren't billed for the VM usage. Your account is only billed for the storage (OS disk, data disks) and networking resources (IPs, etc.) attached to the VM.

When hibernating a VM:
- Hibernation is triggered on a VM using the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDKs, or APIs. Azure then signals the guest operating system to perform suspend-to-disk (S4). 
- The VM's memory contents are stored on the OS disk. The VM is then deallocated, releases the lease on the underlying hardware, and is powered off. Refer to VM [states and billing](states-billing.md) for more details on the VM deallocated state.
- Data in the temporary disk isn't persisted.
- The OS disk, data disks, and NICs remain attached to your VM. Any static IPs remain unchanged.
- You aren't billed for the VM usage for a hibernated VM.
- You continue to be billed for the storage and networking resources associated with the hibernated VM.

## Supported configurations
Hibernation support is limited to certain VM sizes and OS versions. Make sure you have a supported configuration before using hibernation.

### Supported VM sizes 

VM sizes with up to 32-GB RAM from the following VM series support hibernation.  
- [Dasv5-series](dasv5-dadsv5-series.md) 
- [Dadsv5-series](dasv5-dadsv5-series.md) 
- [Dsv5-series](../virtual-machines/dv5-dsv5-series.md)
- [Ddsv5-series](ddv5-ddsv5-series.md) 


### Operating system support and limitations

#### [Linux](#tab/osLimitsLinux)

##### Supported Linux versions
The following Linux operating systems support hibernation:

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Debian 11
- Debian 10 (with backports kernel)

##### Linux Limitations
-	Hibernation isn't supported with Trusted Launch for Linux VMs  


#### [Windows](#tab/osLimitsWindows)

##### Supported Windows versions
The following Windows operating systems support hibernation:

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows 11 Pro
- Windows 11 Enterprise
- Windows 11 Enterprise multi-session
- Windows 10 Pro
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session

##### Windows limitations
-	The page file can't be on the temp disk.  
-	Applications such as Device Guard and Credential Guard that require virtualization-based security (VBS) work with hibernation when you enable Trusted Launch on the VM and Nested Virtualization in the guest OS.
-	Hibernation is only supported with Nested Virtualization when Trusted Launch is enabled on the VM

---

### General limitations
- You can't enable hibernation on existing VMs.
- You can't resize a VM if it has hibernation enabled.
- When a VM is hibernated, you can't attach, detach, or modify any disks or NICs associated with the VM. The VM must instead be moved to a Stop-Deallocated state.
-	When a VM is hibernated, there's no capacity guarantee to ensure that there's sufficient capacity to start the VM later. In the rare case that you encounter capacity issues, you can try starting the VM at a later time. Capacity reservations don't guarantee capacity for hibernated VMs.
-	You can only hibernate a VM using the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, SDKs and API. Hibernating the VM using guest OS operations don't result in the VM moving to a hibernated state and the VM continues to be billed.
-	You can't disable hibernation on a VM once enabled.

### Azure feature limitations
-	Ephemeral OS disks
-	Shared disks
-	Availability Sets
-	Virtual Machine Scale Sets Uniform
-	Spot VMs
-	Managed images
-	Azure Backup
-	Capacity reservations

## Prerequisites to use hibernation
- The hibernate feature is enabled for your subscription.
- A persistent OS disk large enough to store the contents of the RAM, OS and other applications running on the VM is connected.
- The VM size supports hibernation.
-	The VM OS supports hibernation.
- The Azure VM Agent is installed if you're using the Windows or Linux Hibernate Extensions.
- Hibernation is enabled on your VM when creating the VM.
- If a VM is being created from an OS disk or a Compute Gallery image, then the OS disk or Gallery Image definition supports hibernation. 

## Enabling hibernation feature for your subscription
Use the following steps to enable this feature for your subscription:

### [Portal](#tab/enablehiberPortal)
1. In your Azure subscription, go to the Settings section and select 'Preview features'. 
1. Search for 'hibernation'. 
1. Check the 'Hibernation Preview' item.
1. Click 'Register'.

![Screenshot showing the Azure subscription preview portal with 4 numbers representing different steps in enabling the hibernation feature.](./media/hibernate-resume/hibernate-register-preview-feature.png)

### [PowerShell](#tab/enablehiberPS)
```powershell
Register-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "VMHibernationPreview" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Compute"
```
### [CLI](#tab/enablehiberCLI)
```azurecli
az feature register --name VMHibernationPreview --namespace Microsoft.Compute
```
---

Confirm that the registration state is Registered (registration takes a few minutes) using the following command before trying out the feature.

### [Portal](#tab/checkhiberPortal)
In the Azure portal under 'Preview features', select 'Hibernation Preview'. The registration state should show as 'Registered'.

![Screenshot showing the Azure subscription preview portal with the hibernation feature listed as registered.](./media/hibernate-resume/hibernate-is-registered-preview-feature.png)

### [PowerShell](#tab/checkhiberPS)
```powershell
Get-AzProviderFeature -FeatureName "VMHibernationPreview" -ProviderNamespace "Microsoft.Compute"
```
### [CLI](#tab/checkhiberCLI)
```azurecli
az feature show --name VMHibernationPreview --namespace Microsoft.Compute
```
---

## Getting started with hibernation

To hibernate a VM, you must first enable the feature while creating the VM. You can only enable hibernation for a VM on initial creation. You can't enable this feature after the VM is created.

To enable hibernation during VM creation, you can use the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell, ARM templates and API. 

### [Portal](#tab/enableWithPortal)

To enable hibernation in the Azure portal, check the 'Enable hibernation' box during VM creation.

![Screenshot of the checkbox in the Azure portal to enable hibernation when creating a new VM.](./media/hibernate-resume/hibernate-enable-during-vm-creation.png)


### [CLI](#tab/enableWithCLI)

To enable hibernation in the Azure CLI, create a VM by running the following [az vm create]() command with ` --enable-hibernation` set to `true`.

```azurecli
 az vm create --resource-group myRG \
   --name myVM \
   --image Win2019Datacenter \
   --public-ip-sku Standard \
   --size Standard_D2s_v5 \
   --enable-hibernation true 
```

### [PowerShell](#tab/enableWithPS)

To enable hibernation when creating a VM with PowerShell, run the following command:

```powershell
New-AzVm ` 
 -ResourceGroupName 'myRG' ` 
 -Name 'myVM' ` 
 -Location 'East US' ` 
 -VirtualNetworkName 'myVnet' ` 
 -SubnetName 'mySubnet' ` 
 -SecurityGroupName 'myNetworkSecurityGroup' ` 
 -PublicIpAddressName 'myPublicIpAddress' ` 
 -Size Standard_D2s_v5 ` 
 -Image Win2019Datacenter ` 
 -HibernationEnabled ` 
 -OpenPorts 80,3389 
```

### [REST](#tab/enableWithREST)

First, [create a VM with hibernation enabled](/rest/api/compute/virtual-machines/create-or-update#create-a-vm-with-hibernationenabled)

```json
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vm-name}?api-version=2021-11-01
```
Your output should look something like this:

```
{
  "location": "eastus",
  "properties": {
    "hardwareProfile": {
      "vmSize": "Standard_D2s_v5"
    },
    "additionalCapabilities": {
      "hibernationEnabled": true
    },
    "storageProfile": {

Once you've created a VM with hibernation enabled, you need to configure the guest OS to successfully hibernate your VM. 

## Guest configuration for hibernation

### Configuring hibernation on Linux
There are many ways you can configure the guest OS for hibernation in Linux VMs.  

#### Option 1: LinuxHibernateExtension
When you create a Hibernation-enabled VM via the Azure portal, the LinuxHibernationExtension is automatically installed on the VM. 

If the extension is missing, you can [manually install the LinuxHibernateExtension](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview) on your Linux VM to configure the guest OS for hibernation. 

>[!NOTE]
> Azure extensions are currently disabled by default for Debian images. To re-enable extensions, [check the hibernation troubleshooting guide](hibernate-resume-troubleshooting.md#azure-extensions-disabled-on-debian-images).

##### [CLI](#tab/cliLHE)
    
To install LinuxHibernateExtension with the Azure CLI, run the following command:

```azurecli
az vm extension set -n LinuxHibernateExtension --publisher Microsoft.CPlat.Core --version 1.0 \    --vm-name MyVm --resource-group MyResourceGroup --enable-auto-upgrade true
```

##### [PowerShell](#tab/powershellLHE)

To install LinuxHibernateExtension with PowerShell, run the following command:

```powershell
Set-AzVMExtension -Publisher Microsoft.CPlat.Core -ExtensionType LinuxHibernateExtension -VMName <VMName> -ResourceGroupName <RGNAME> -Name "LinuxHibernateExtension" -Location <Location> -TypeHandlerVersion 1.0
```  
---

#### Option 2: hibernation-setup-tool 
You can install the hibernation-setup-tool package on your Linux VM from Microsoft’s Linux software repository at [packages.microsoft.com](https://packages.microsoft.com).

To use the Linux software repository, follow the instructions at [Linux package repository for Microsoft software](/windows-server/administration/Linux-Package-Repository-for-Microsoft-Software#ubuntu).

##### [Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)](#tab/Ubuntu18HST) 

To use the repository in Ubuntu 18.04, open git bash and run this command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-add-repository https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod

sudo apt-get update
```

##### [Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)](#tab/Ubuntu20HST) 

To use the repository in Ubuntu 20.04, open git bash and run this command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo tee etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc

sudo apt-add-repository https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod

sudo apt-get update
```
---


To install the package, run this command in git bash:
```bash
sudo apt-get install hibernation-setup-tool
```

Once the package installs successfully, your Linux guest OS has been configured for hibernation. You can also create a new Azure Compute Gallery Image from this VM and use the image to create VMs. VMs created with this image have the hibernation package preinstalled, thereby simplifying your VM creation experience. 

### Configuring hibernation on Windows
Enabling hibernation while creating a Windows VM automatically installs the 'Microsoft.CPlat.Core.WindowsHibernateExtension' VM extension. This extension configures the guest OS for hibernation. This extension doesn't need to be manually installed or updated, as this extension is managed by the Azure platform.

>[!NOTE]
>When you create a VM with hibernation enabled, Azure automatically places the page file on the C: drive. If you're using a specialized image, then you'll need to follow additional steps to ensure that the pagefile is located on the C: drive. 

>[!NOTE]
>Using the WindowsHibernateExtension requires the Azure VM Agent to be installed on the VM. If you choose to opt-out of the Azure VM Agent, then you can configure the OS for hibernation by running powercfg /h /type full inside the guest. You can then verify if hibernation is enabled inside guest using the powercfg /a command.

## Hibernating a VM

Once a VM with hibernation enabled has been created and the guest OS is configured for hibernation, you can hibernate the VM through the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, PowerShell, or REST API. 


#### [Portal](#tab/PortalDoHiber) 

To hibernate a VM in the Azure portal, click the 'Hibernate' button on the VM Overview page.

![Screenshot of the button to hibernate a VM in the Azure portal.](./media/hibernate-resume/hibernate-overview-button.png)

#### [CLI](#tab/CLIDoHiber) 

To hibernate a VM in the Azure CLI, run this command:

```azurecli
az vm deallocate --resource-group TestRG --name TestVM --hibernate true 
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/PSDoHiber)  

To hibernate a VM in PowerShell, run this command:

```powershell
Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" -Name "TestVM" -Hibernate      
```

After running the above command, enter 'Y' to continue:

```
Virtual machine stopping operation 

This cmdlet will stop the specified virtual machine. Do you want to continue? 

[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y 
```

#### [REST API](#tab/APIDoHiber) 

To hibernate a VM using the REST API, run this command:

```json
POST 
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/.../providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{vmName}/deallocate?hibernate=true&api-version=2021-03-01 
```

## View state of hibernated VM 

#### [Portal](#tab/PortalStatCheck)

To view the state of a VM in the portal, check the 'Status' on the overview page. It should report as "Hibernated (deallocated)"

![Screenshot of the Hibernated VM's status in the Azure portal listing as 'Hibernated (deallocated)'.](./media/hibernate-resume/is-hibernated-status.png)

#### [PowerShell](#tab/PSStatCheck)

To view the state of a VM using PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "testRG" -Name "testVM" -Status 
```

Your output should look something like this:

## Deploy hibernation enabled VMs from the Azure Compute Gallery

VMs created from Compute Gallery images can also be enabled for hibernation. Ensure that the OS version associated with your Gallery image supports hibernation on Azure. Refer to the list of supported OS versions.

To create VMs with hibernation enabled using Gallery images, you'll first need to create a new image definition with the hibernation property enabled. Once this feature property is enabled on the Gallery Image definition, you can [create an image version](/azure/virtual-machines/image-version?tabs=portal#create-an-image) and use that image version to create hibernation enabled VMs. 

>[!NOTE]
> For specialized Windows images, the page file location must be set to C: drive in order for Azure to successfully configure your guest OS for hibernation.
> If you're creating an Image version from an existing VM, you should first move the page file to the OS disk and then use the VM as the source for the Image version.

#### [Portal](#tab/PortalImageGallery)
To create an image definition with the hibernation property enabled, select the checkmark for 'Enable hibernation'.

![Screenshot of the option to enable hibernation in the Azure portal while creating a VM image definition.](./media/hibernate-resume/hibernate-images-support.png)


#### [CLI](#tab/CLIImageGallery)
```azurecli
az sig image-definition create --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
--gallery-name MyGallery --gallery-image-definition MyImage \
--publisher GreatPublisher --offer GreatOffer --sku GreatSku \
--os-type linux --os-state Specialized \
--features IsHibernateSupported=true
```

#### [PowerShell](#tab/PSImageGallery)
```powershell
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$galleryName = "myGallery"
$galleryImageDefinitionName = "myImage"
$location = "eastus"
$publisherName = "GreatPublisher"
$offerName = "GreatOffer"
$skuName = "GreatSku"
$description = "My gallery"
$IsHibernateSupported = @{Name='IsHibernateSupported';Value='True'} 
$features = @($IsHibernateSupported)
New-AzGalleryImageDefinition -ResourceGroupName $rgName -GalleryName $galleryName -Name $galleryImageDefinitionName -Location $location -Publisher $publisherName -Offer $offerName -Sku $skuName -OsState "Generalized" -OsType "Windows" -Description $description -Feature $features
```
---

## Deploy hibernation enabled VMs from an OS disk 

VMs created from OS disks can also be enabled for hibernation. Ensure that the OS version associated with your OS disk supports hibernation on Azure. Refer to the list of supported OS versions.

To create VMs with hibernation enabled using OS disks, ensure that the OS disk has the hibernation property enabled. Refer to API example to enable this property on OS disks. Once the hibernation property is enabled on the OS disk, you can create hibernation enabled VMs using that OS disk.

```
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/disks/myDisk?api-version=2021-12-01

{
  "properties": {
    "supportsHibernation": true
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting
Refer to the [Hibernate troubleshooting guide](./hibernate-resume-troubleshooting.md) for more information

## FAQs

- What are the charges for using this feature?
    - Once a VM is placed in a hibernated state, you aren't charged for the VM, just like how you aren't charged for VMs in a stop (deallocated) state. You're only charged for the OS disk, data disks and any static IPs associated with the VM.

- Can I enable hibernation on existing VMs?
    - No, you can't enable hibernation on existing VMs. You can only enable hibernation at the time of creating a VM.

- Can I resize a VM with hibernation enabled?
    - No. Once you enable hibernation on a VM, you can't resize the VM. 

- Can I modify a VM once it is in a hibernated state?
    - No, once a VM is in a hibernated state, you can't perform actions like resizing the VM and modifying the disks. Additionally, you can't detach any disks or networking resources that are currently attached to the VM or attach new resources to the VM. You can however stop(deallocate) or delete the VM if you want to detach these resources. 

- What is the difference between stop(deallocating) and hibernating a VM?
    - When you stop(deallocate) a VM, the VM shuts down without persisting the memory contents. You can resize stop(deallocated) VMs and detach/attach disks to the VM.

    - When you hibernate a VM, the memory contents are first persisted in the OS disk, then the VM hibernates. You can't resize VMs in a hibernated state, nor detach/attach disks and networking resources to the VM.

- Can you disable hibernation?
    - No, you can't disable hibernation on a VM. 

- Can I initiate hibernation from within the VM?
    - To hibernate a VM you should use the Azure portal, CLI, PowerShell commands, SDKs and APIs. Triggering hibernation from inside the VM still results in your VM being billed for the compute resources. 

- When a VM is hibernated, is there a capacity assurance at the time of starting the VM?
    - No, there's no capacity assurance for starting hibernated VMs. In rare scenarios if you encounter a capacity issue, then you can try starting the VM at a later time.
