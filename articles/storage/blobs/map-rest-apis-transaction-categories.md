# Map each REST operation to a price

This article helps you find the price of each REST operation that clients can execute against the Azure Blob Storage service. 

Each request made by tools such as AzCopy or Azure Storage Explorer arrives to the service in the form of a REST operation. This is also true for a custom application that leverages an Azure Storage Client library. 

To determine the price of each operation, you must first determine how that operation is classified in terms of its _type_. That's because the pricing pages list prices only by operation type and not by each individual operation. Use the tables in this article as a guide.

## Operation type of each Blob Storage REST operation

The following table maps each Blob Storage REST operation to an operation type.

The price of each type appears in the [Azure Blob Storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/) page.

| Operation                                                                                 | Premium block blob        | Standard general-purpose v2 | Standard general-purpose v1 |
