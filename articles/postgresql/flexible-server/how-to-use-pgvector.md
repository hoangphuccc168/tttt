# How to enable and use `pgvector` on Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

## Enable extension

Before you can enable `pgvector` on your Flexible Server, you need to add it to your allowlist as described in [how to use PostgreSQL extensions](./concepts-extensions.md#how-to-use-postgresql-extensions) and check if it's correctly added by running `SHOW azure.extensions;`.

Then you can install the extension, by connecting to your target database and running the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html) command. You need to repeat the command separately for every database you want the extension to be available in.

```postgresql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

> [!Note]
> To remove the extension from the currently connected database use `DROP EXTENSION vector;`.
