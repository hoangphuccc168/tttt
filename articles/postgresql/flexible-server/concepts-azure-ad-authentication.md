# Microsoft Entra authentication with PostgreSQL Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-Flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-Flexible-server.md)]


Microsoft Entra authentication is a mechanism of connecting to Azure Database for PostgreSQL using identities defined in Microsoft Entra ID.
With Microsoft Entra authentication, you can manage database user identities and other Microsoft services in a central location, which simplifies permission management.

Benefits of using Microsoft Entra ID include:

- Authentication of users across Azure Services in a uniform way
- Management of password policies and password rotation in a single place
- Multiple forms of authentication supported by Microsoft Entra ID, which can eliminate the need to store passwords
- Customers can manage database permissions using external (Microsoft Entra ID) groups.
- Microsoft Entra authentication uses PostgreSQL database roles to authenticate identities at the database level
- Support of token-based authentication for applications connecting to Azure Database for PostgreSQL

## Microsoft Entra authentication (Single Server VS Flexible Server)

Microsoft Entra authentication for Flexible Server is built using our experience and feedback we've collected from Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Server, and supports the following features and improvements over single server:

The following table provides a list of high-level Microsoft Entra features and capabilities comparisons between Single Server and Flexible Server

| **Feature / Capability** | **Single Server** | **Flexible Server** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multiple Microsoft Entra Admins | No | Yes |
| Managed Identities (System & User assigned) | Partial | Full |
| Invited User Support | No | Yes |
| Disable Password Authentication | Not Available | Available |
| Service Principal can act as group member | No | Yes |
| Audit Microsoft Entra Logins | No | Yes |
| PG bouncer support | No | Yes |

## How Microsoft Entra ID Works In Flexible Server

The following high-level diagram summarizes how authentication works using Microsoft Entra authentication with Azure Database for PostgreSQL. The arrows indicate communication pathways.

## Manage PostgreSQL Access For AD Principals

When Microsoft Entra authentication is enabled and Microsoft Entra principal is added as a Microsoft Entra administrator the account gets the same privileges as the original PostgreSQL administrator. Only Microsoft Entra administrator can manage other Microsoft Entra ID enabled roles on the server using Azure portal or Database API. The Microsoft Entra administrator sign-in can be a Microsoft Entra user, Microsoft Entra group, Service Principal or Managed Identity. Using a group account as an administrator enhances manageability by allowing you to centrally add and remove group members in Microsoft Entra ID without changing the users or permissions in the PostgreSQL server. Multiple Microsoft Entra administrators can be configured at any time and you can optionally disable password authentication to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server for better auditing and compliance needs.

![admin structure][2]

 > [!NOTE]  
 > Service Principal or Managed Identity can now act as fully functional Microsoft Entra Administrator in Flexible Server and this was a limitation in our Single Server.

Microsoft Entra administrators that are created via Portal, API or SQL would have the same permissions as the regular admin user created during server provisioning. Additionally, database permissions for non-admin Microsoft Entra ID enabled roles are managed similar to regular roles.

## Connect using Microsoft Entra identities

Microsoft Entra authentication supports the following methods of connecting to a database using Microsoft Entra identities:

- Microsoft Entra Password
- Microsoft Entra integrated
- Microsoft Entra Universal with MFA
- Using Active Directory Application certificates or client secrets
- [Managed Identity](how-to-connect-with-managed-identity.md)

Once you've authenticated against the Active Directory, you then retrieve a token. This token is your password for logging in.

## Other considerations

- Multiple Microsoft Entra principals (a user, group, service principal or managed identity) can be configured as Microsoft Entra Administrator for an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server at any time.
- Only a Microsoft Entra administrator for PostgreSQL can initially connect to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL using a Microsoft Entra account. The Active Directory administrator can configure subsequent Microsoft Entra database users.
-  If a Microsoft Entra principal is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID, it still remains as PostgreSQL role, but it will no longer be able to acquire new access token. In this case, although the matching role still exists in the database it won't be able to authenticate to the server. Database administrators need to transfer ownership and drop roles manually.

> [!NOTE]  
> Login with the deleted Microsoft Entra user can still be done till the token expires (up to 60 minutes from token issuing).  If you also remove the user from Azure Database for PostgreSQL this access will be revoked immediately.

- Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server matches access tokens to the database role using the userâ€™s unique Microsoft Entra user ID, as opposed to using the username. If a Microsoft Entra user is deleted and a new user is created with the same name, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server considers that a different user. Therefore, if a user is deleted from Microsoft Entra ID and a new user is added with the same name the new user won't be able to connect with the existing role.
