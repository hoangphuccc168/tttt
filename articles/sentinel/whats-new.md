## October 2023

- [Microsoft Applied Skill - Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel](#microsoft-applied-skill-available-for-microsoft-sentinel)
- [Changes to the documentation table of contents](#changes-to-the-documentation-table-of-contents)

### Microsoft Applied Skill available for Microsoft Sentinel

This month Microsoft Worldwide Learning announced [Applied Skills](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-learn-blog/announcing-microsoft-applied-skills-the-new-credentials-to/ba-p/3775645) to help you acquire the technical skills you need to reach your full potential. Microsoft Sentinel is included in the initial set of credentials offered! This credential is based on the learning path with the same name.
- **Learning path** - [Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel](/training/paths/configure-security-information-event-management-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/)
  <br>Learn at your own pace, and the modules require you to have your own Azure subscription.
- **Applied Skill** - [Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel](/credentials/applied-skills/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/)
  <br>A 2 hour assessment is contained in a sandbox virtual desktop. You are provided an Azure subscription with some features already configured.

### Changes to the documentation table of contents

We've made some significant changes in how the Microsoft Sentinel documentation is organized in the table of contents on the left-hand side of the library. Two important things to know:

- Bookmarked links persist. Unless we retire an article, your saved and shared links to Microsoft Sentinel articles still work.
- Articles used to be divided by concepts, how-tos, and tutorials. Now, the articles are organized by lifecycle or scenario with the related concepts, how-tos, and tutorials in those buckets.

We hope these changes to the organization makes your exploration of Microsoft Sentinel documentation more intuitive!

## September 2023

- [Improve SOX compliance with new workbook for SAP](#improve-sox-compliance-with-new-workbook-for-sap)

### Improve SOX compliance with new workbook for SAP

The **SAP Audit Controls workbook** is now provided to you as part of the [Microsoft Sentinel solution for SAP® applications](./sap/solution-overview.md).

This workbook helps you check your SAP® environment's security controls for compliance with your chosen control framework, be it [SOX](https://www.bing.com/search?q=sox+compliance+IT+security&qs=n&form=QBRE&sp=-1&lq=0&pq=sox+compliance+it+security&sc=8-26&sk=&cvid=3ACE338C88CE43368A223D4DB7FC35E6&ghsh=0&ghacc=0&ghpl=), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/framework), or a custom framework of your choice.

The workbook provides tools for you to assign analytics rules in your environment to specific security controls and control families,  monitor and categorize the incidents generated by the SAP solution-based analytics rules, and report on your compliance.

Learn more about the [**SAP Audit Controls workbook**](./sap/sap-audit-controls-workbook.md).

## August 2023

- [New incident investigation experience is now GA](#new-incident-investigation-experience-is-now-ga)
- [Updated MISP2Sentinel solution utilizes the new upload indicators API.](#updated-misp2sentinel-solution)
- [New and improved entity pages](#new-and-improved-entity-pages)

### New incident investigation experience is now GA

Microsoft Sentinel's comprehensive [incident investigation and case management experience](incident-investigation.md) is now generally available in both commercial and government clouds. This experience includes the revamped incident page, which itself includes displays of the incident's entities, insights, and similar incidents for comparison. The new experience also includes an incident log history and a task list.

Also generally available are the similar incidents widget and the ability to add entities to your threat intelligence list of indicators of compromise (IoCs).

- Learn more about [investigating incidents](investigate-incidents.md) in Microsoft Sentinel.

### Updated MISP2Sentinel solution

The open source threat intelligence sharing platform, MISP, has an updated solution to push indicators to Microsoft Sentinel. This notable solution utilizes the new upload indicators API to take advantage of workspace granularity and align the MISP ingested TI to STIX-based properties.

Learn more about the implementation details from the [MISP blog entry for MISP2Sentinel](https://www.misp-project.org/2023/08/26/MISP-Sentinel-UploadIndicatorsAPI.html/).

### New and improved entity pages

Microsoft Sentinel now provides you enhanced and enriched entity pages and panels, giving you more security information on user accounts, full entity data to enrich your incident context, and a reduction in latency for a faster, smoother experience.
