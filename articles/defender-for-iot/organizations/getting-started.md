# Start a Microsoft Defender for IoT trial

This article describes how to set up a trial license and create an initial OT plan for Microsoft Defender for IoT, for customers who don't have any Microsoft tenant or Azure subscription at all. Use Defender for IoT to monitor network traffic across your OT networks.

A trial supports a **Large** site size with up to 1000 devices, and lasts for 60 days. You might want to use this trial with a [virtual sensor](tutorial-onboarding.md) or on-premises sensors to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, all you need is an email address that will be used as the contact for your new Microsoft Tenant.

You'll also need to enter credit card details for your new Azure subscription, although you won't be charged until you switch from the **Free Trial** to the **Pay-As-You-Go** plan.
