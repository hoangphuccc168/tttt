Disaster recovery (DR) is about recovering from high-impact events, such as natural disasters or failed deployments that result in downtime and data loss. Regardless of the cause, the best remedy for a disaster is a well-defined and tested DR plan and an application design that actively supports DR.  

When it comes to DR, Microsoft uses the [shared responsibility model](../business-continuity-management-program.md#shared-responsibility-model). The shared responsibility model means that Microsoft ensures that the baseline infrastructure and platform services are available. However, in some scenarios, usage requires that the customer to duplicate their deployments and storage in a multi-region capacity, if they opt to. 

Most services that run on Azure platform as a service (PaaS) offerings provide features and guidance to support DR. For some scenarios, you can use service-specific features to support fast recovery.

When you plan to deploy your application, it's helpful to understand Azure regions and geographies. For more information, see [Azure cross-region replication](../cross-region-replication-azure.md).
