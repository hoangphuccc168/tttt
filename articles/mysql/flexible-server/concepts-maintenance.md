# Scheduled maintenance in Azure Database for MySQL â€“ Flexible server

[[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-flexible-server.md)]

Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible server performs periodic maintenance to keep your managed database secure, stable, and up-to-date. During maintenance, the server gets new features, updates, and patches.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please avoid all server operations (modifications, configuration changes, starting/stopping server) during Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server maintenance. Engaging in these activities can lead to unpredictable outcomes, possibly affecting server performance and stability. Wait until maintenance concludes before conducting server operations.

## Select a maintenance window

You can schedule maintenance during a specific day of the week and a time window within that day. Or you can let the system pick a day and a time window time for you automatically. Either way, the system will alert you five days before running any maintenance. The system will also let you know when maintenance is started, and when it is successfully completed.

Notifications about upcoming scheduled maintenance can be:

* Emailed to a specific address
* Emailed to an Azure Resource Manager Role
* Sent in a text message (SMS) to mobile devices
* Pushed as a notification to an Azure app
* Delivered as a voice message

When specifying preferences for the maintenance schedule, you can pick a day of the week and a time window. If you don't specify, the system will pick times between 11pm and 7am in your server's region time. You can define different schedules for each flexible server in your Azure subscription.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Normally there are at least 30 days between successful scheduled maintenance events for a server.
>
> However, in case of a critical emergency update such as a severe vulnerability, the notification window could be shorter than five days. The critical update may be applied to your server even if a successful scheduled maintenance was performed in the last 30 days.

You can update scheduling settings at any time. If there is a maintenance scheduled for your Flexible server and you update scheduling preferences, the current rollout will proceed as scheduled and the scheduling settings change will become effective upon its successful completion for the next scheduled maintenance.

You can define system-managed schedule or custom schedule for each flexible server in your Azure subscription.
* With custom schedule, you can specify your maintenance window for the server by choosing the day of the week and a one-hour time window.
* With system-managed schedule, the system will pick any one-hour window between 11pm and 7am in your server's region time.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Previously, a 7-day deployment gap between system-managed and custom-managed schedules was maintained. Due to evolving maintenance demands and the introduction of the [maintenance reschedule feature (preview)](#maintenance-reschedule-preview), we can no longer guarantee this 7-day gap.

In rare cases, maintenance event can be canceled by the system or may fail to complete successfully. If the update fails, the update will be reverted, and the previous version of the binaries is restored. In such failed update scenarios, you may still experience restart of the server during the maintenance window. If the update is canceled or failed, the system will create a notification about canceled or failed maintenance event respectively notifying you. The next attempt to perform maintenance will be scheduled as per your current scheduling settings and you will receive notification about it five days in advance.

## Maintenance reschedule (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The maintenance reschedule feature is currently in preview. It is subject to limitations and ongoing development. We value your feedback to help enhance this feature. Please note that this feature is not available for servers using the burstable SKU.

The **maintenance reschedule** feature grants you greater control over the timing of maintenance activities on your Azure MySQL - Flexible server. After receiving a maintenance notification, you can reschedule it to a more convenient time, irrespective of whether it was system or custom managed.

### Reschedule parameters and notifications

Rescheduling isn't confined to fixed time slots; it depends on the earliest and latest permissible times in the current maintenance cycle. Upon rescheduling, a notification will be sent out to confirm the changes, following the standard notification policies.

### Considerations and limitations

Be aware of the following when using this feature:

- **Demand Constraints:** Your rescheduled maintenance might be canceled due to a high number of maintenance activities occurring simultaneously in the same region.
- **Lock-in Period:** Rescheduling is unavailable 15 minutes prior to the initially scheduled maintenance time to maintain the reliability of the service.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend monitoring notifications closely during the preview stage to accommodate potential adjustments.

Use this feature to avoid disruptions during critical database operations. We encourage your feedback as we continue to develop this functionality.
