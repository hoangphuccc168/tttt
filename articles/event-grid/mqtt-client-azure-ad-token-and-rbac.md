# Microsoft Entra JWT authentication and Azure RBAC authorization to publish or subscribe MQTT messages

You can authenticate MQTT clients with Microsoft Entra JWT to connect to Event Grid namespace.  You can use Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to enable MQTT clients, with Microsoft Entra identity, to publish or subscribe access to specific topic spaces.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported only when using MQTT v5 protocol version

## Prerequisites
- You need an Event Grid namespace with MQTT enabled.  Learn about [creating Event Grid namespace](/azure/event-grid/create-view-manage-namespaces#create-a-namespace)

## Authentication using Microsoft Entra JWT
You can use the MQTT v5 CONNECT packet to provide the Microsoft Entra JWT token to authenticate your client, and you can use the MQTT v5 AUTH packet to refresh the token.  

In CONNECT packet, you can provide required values in the following fields:

|Field  | Value  |
|---------|---------|
|Authentication Method | OAUTH2-JWT |
|Authentication Data | JWT token |

In AUTH packet, you can provide required values in the following fields:

|Field | Value |
|---------|---------|
| Authentication Method | OAUTH2-JWT |
| Authentication Data | JWT token |
| Authentication Reason Code | 25 |
 
Authenticate Reason Code with value 25 signifies reauthentication.

> [!NOTE]
> Audience: “aud” claim must be set to "https://eventgrid.azure.net/".

## Authorization to grant access permissions
A client using Microsoft Entra ID based JWT authentication needs to be authorized to communicate with the Event Grid namespace.  You can assign the following two built-in roles to provide either publish or subscribe permissions, to clients with Microsoft Entra identities.

- Use **EventGrid TopicSpaces Publisher** role to provide MQTT message publisher access
- Use **EventGrid TopicSpaces Subscriber** role to provide MQTT message subscriber access

You can use these roles to provide permissions at subscription, resource group, Event Grid namespace or Event Grid topicspace scope.

## Assigning the publisher role to your Microsoft Entra identity at topicspace scope

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your Event Grid namespace
1. Navigate to the topicspace to which you want to authorize access.
1. Go to the Access control (IAM) page of the topicspace
1. Select the **Role assignments** tab to view the role assignments at this scope.
1. Select **+ Add** and Add role assignment.
1. On the Role tab, select the "EventGrid TopicSpaces Publisher" role.
1. On the Members tab, for **Assign access to**, select User, group, or service principal option to assign the selected role to one or more service principals (applications).
    - Users and groups work when user/group belong to fewer than 200 groups.
1. Select **+ Select members**.
1. Find and select the users, groups, or service principals.
1. Select **Next**
1. Select **Review + assign** on the Review + assign tab.

> [!NOTE]
> You can follow similar steps to assign the built-in EventGrid TopicSpaces Subscriber role at topicspace scope.
