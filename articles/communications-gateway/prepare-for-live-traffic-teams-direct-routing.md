# Prepare for live traffic with Microsoft Teams Direct Routing and Azure Communications Gateway

Before you can launch your Microsoft Teams Direct Routing service, you and your onboarding team must:

- Test your service.
- Prepare for launch.

In this article, you learn about the steps that you and your Azure Communications Gateway onboarding team must take.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some steps can require days or weeks to complete. We recommend that you read through these steps in advance to work out a timeline.

## Prerequisites

You must have completed the following procedures.

- [Prepare to deploy Azure Communications Gateway](prepare-to-deploy.md)
- [Deploy Azure Communications Gateway](deploy.md)
- [Integrate with Azure Communications Gateway's Provisioning API](integrate-with-provisioning-api.md)
- [Connect Azure Communications Gateway to Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](connect-teams-direct-routing.md)
- [Configure a test customer for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](configure-test-customer-teams-direct-routing.md)
- [Configure test numbers for Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](configure-test-numbers-teams-direct-routing.md)

## Carry out integration testing and request changes

Network integration includes identifying SIP interoperability requirements and configuring devices to meet these requirements. For example, this process often includes interworking header formats and/or the signaling & media flows used for call hold and session refresh.

You must test typical call flows for your network. Your onboarding team will provide an example test plan that we recommend you follow. Your test plan should include call flow, failover, and connectivity testing.

- If you decide that you need changes to Azure Communications Gateway, ask your onboarding team. Microsoft must make the changes for you.
- If you need changes to the configuration of devices in your core network, you must make those changes.
