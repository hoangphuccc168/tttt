# Your network and Azure Communications Gateway

Azure Communications Gateway sits at the edge of your network. This position allows it to manipulate signaling and media to meet the requirements of your networks and your chosen communications services (for example, Microsoft Operator Connect or Zoom Phone Cloud Peering). Azure Communications Gateway includes many interoperability settings by default, and you can arrange further interoperability configuration.

> [!TIP]
> This section provides a brief overview of Azure Communications Gateway's interoperability features. For detailed information about interoperability with a specific communications service, see:
> - [Interoperability of Azure Communications Gateway with Operator Connect and Teams Phone Mobile](interoperability-operator-connect.md).
> - [Interoperability of Azure Communications Gateway with Microsoft Teams Direct Routing](interoperability-teams-direct-routing.md).

## Role and position in the network

Azure Communications Gateway sits at the edge of your fixed line and mobile networks. It connects these networks to one or more communications services. The following diagram shows where Azure Communications Gateway sits in your network.

Azure Communications Gateway provides all the features of a traditional session border controller (SBC). These features include:

- Signaling interworking features to solve interoperability problems
- Advanced media manipulation and interworking
- Defending against Denial of Service attacks and other malicious traffic
- Ensuring Quality of Service

Azure Communications Gateway also offers metrics for monitoring your deployment.

## Network requirements

We expect your network to have two geographically redundant sites. You must provide networking connections between each site and:

* The other site in your deployment, as cross-connects.
* The two Azure Regions in which you deploy Azure Communications Gateway.

Connectivity between your networks and Azure Communications Gateway must meet any relevant network connectivity specifications.

The following diagram shows an operator network using MAPS or ExpressRoute (as recommended) to connect to Azure Communications Gateway.

For more information on how to route calls between Azure Communications Gateway and your network, see [Call routing requirements](reliability-communications-gateway.md#call-routing-requirements).

## SIP signaling support

Azure Communications Gateway includes SIP trunks to your own network and can interwork between your existing core networks and the requirements of your chosen communications service.

[!INCLUDE [communications-gateway-multitenant](includes/communications-gateway-multitenant.md)]

You can arrange more interworking function as part of your initial network design or at any time by raising a support request for Azure Communications Gateway. For example, you might need extra interworking configuration for:

- Advanced SIP header or SDP message manipulation
- Support for reliable provisional messages (100rel)
- Interworking between early and late media
- Interworking away from inband DTMF tones

## RTP and SRTP media support

Azure Communications Gateway supports both RTP and SRTP, and can interwork between them. Azure Communications Gateway offers other media manipulation features to allow your networks to interoperate with your chosen communications services. For example, you can use Azure Communications for:

- Changing how RTCP is handled
- Controlling bandwidth allocation
- Prioritizing specific media traffic for Quality of Service

For full details of the media interworking features available in Azure Communications Gateway, raise a support request.
