# Security recommendations for DevOps resources - a reference guide

This article lists the recommendations you might see in Microsoft Defender for Cloud if you've [connected an Azure DevOps](quickstart-onboard-devops.md) or [GitHub](quickstart-onboard-github.md) environment from the **Environment settings** page. The recommendations shown in your environment depend on the resources you're protecting and your customized configuration.

To learn about how to respond to these recommendations, see
[Remediate recommendations in Defender for Cloud](implement-security-recommendations.md).

DevOps recommendations do not currently affect the [Secure Score](secure-score-security-controls.md). To prioritize recommendations, consider the number of impacted resources, the total number of findings and the level of severity.
