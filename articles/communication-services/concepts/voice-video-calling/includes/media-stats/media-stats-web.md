## Media quality statistics for an ongoing call

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There's an API breaking change on media quality statistics in the SDK, beginning with version 1.8.0-beta.1.

Media quality statistics is an extended feature of the core `Call` API. You first need to obtain the `mediaStatsFeature` API object:

```js
const mediaStatsFeature = call.feature(Features.MediaStats);
```

Then, define `mediaStatsCollectorOptions` of type `MediaStatsCollectorOptions` if you want control over intervals. Otherwise, the SDK uses default values.

```js
const mediaStatsCollectorOptions: SDK.MediaStatsCollectorOptions = {
    aggregationInterval: 10,
    dataPointsPerAggregation: 6
};
```

In the preceding code:

- `aggregationInterval` is the interval, in seconds, that the statistics will be aggregated.
- `dataPointsPerAggregation` defines how many data points each aggregation event has.

After you add an event listener to the media statistics collector, you receive a `mediaStatsEmitted` or `summaryReported` event with statistics every `aggregationInterval * dataPointsPerAggregation` seconds.

For example, if you set the following values:

- `aggregationInterval` = 1
- `dataPointsPerAggregation` = 60

The `mediaStatsEmitted` or `summaryReported` event is raised every 60 seconds and contains 60 unique units for each statistic recorded.

If you set the following values:

- `aggregatinInterval` = 60
- `dataPointsPerAggregation` = 1

The `mediaStatsEmitted` or `summaryReported` event is raised every 60 seconds and contains 1 unique unit for each statistic recorded.

### SDK version 1.8.0 beta and later

As a developer, you can invoke the `createCollector` method with optional `mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions`.
To receive the media statistics data, you can subscribe `sampleReported` event or `summaryReported` event.
`sampleReported` event triggers every second. It is suitable as a data source for UI display or your own data pipeline.
`summaryReported` event contains the aggregated values of the data over intervals, which is useful when you just need a summary.

```js
const mediaStatsCollector = mediaStatsFeature.createCollector(mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions);

mediaStatsCollector.on('sampleReported', (sample) => {
    console.log('media stats sample', sample);
});

mediaStatsCollector.on('summaryReported', (summary) => {
    console.log('media stats summary', summary);
});
```

In case you don't need to use the media statistics collector, you can call `dispose` method of `mediaStatsCollector`.

```js
mediaStatsCollector.dispose();
```
It is not necessary to call `dispose` method of `mediaStatsCollector` every time when the call ends, as the collectors will be reclaimed internally when the call ends.
However, if you are using SDK version less than 1.8.0-beta.1, you need use `disposeAllCollectors` API to release the resource.

## Best practices

If you want to collect the data for offline inspection, we recommend that you collect the data and send it to your pipeline ingestion after your call ends. If you transmit the data during a call, it could use internet bandwidth that's needed to continue an Azure Communication Services call (especially when available bandwidth is low).

## Media quality statistics metrics for SDK version 1.8.0 beta and later

In either `sampleReported` event or `summaryReported` event, the media statistics data are not just a simple key-value mapping.

Here is the type declaration of the event data reported by `sampleReported` event.
```typescript
export interface MediaStatsReportSample {
    audio: {
        send: AudioSendMediaStats<MediaStatRawValue>[];
        receive: AudioRecvMediaStats<MediaStatRawValue>[];
    };
    video: {
        send: VideoSendMediaStats<MediaStatRawValue>[];
        receive: VideoRecvMediaStats<MediaStatRawValue>[];
    };
    screenShare: {
        send: ScreenShareSendMediaStats<MediaStatRawValue>[];
        receive: ScreenShareRecvMediaStats<MediaStatRawValue>[];
    };
}

```
The event data provide the statistics data for each media stream in the call, including both send and recv directions.
It is recommended that you print out the event using the `console.log` to observe its layout and value changes, so you can find a proper way to display or process the data according to your usage scenario.


The bandwidth metrics have changes to `availableBitrate` in audio send and video send metrics.

### Audio send metrics

| Metric name | Description | Comments |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `id` | Statistics ID | It's used to identify statistics across the events, especially when there are multiple statistics with the same media type and direction in an event. |
| `codecName` | Codec name | OPUS, G722.|
| `bitrate` | Audio send bit rate (bits per second) | General values are in the 24-Kbps range (36-128 Kbps is typical). |
| `jitterInMs` | Packet jitter (milliseconds) | Lower is better. |
| `packetsPerSecond` | Packet rate (packets per second) | |
| `packetsLostPerSecond` | Packet loss rate (packets per second) | Lower is better. |

### Screen-share receive metrics

### Using media quality statistics on SDK versions earlier than 1.8.0

If you're using an Azure Communication Services SDK version earlier than 1.8.0, this section describes how to use this functionality.

As a developer, you can invoke the `startCollector` method with optional `mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions`.

```js
const mediaStatsCollector = mediaStatsFeature.startCollector(mediaStatsSubscriptionOptions);

mediaStatsCollector.on('mediaStatsEmitted', (mediaStats) => {
    console.log('media stats:', mediaStats.stats);
    console.log('media stats collectionInterval:', mediaStats.collectionInterval);
    console.log('media stats aggregationInterval:', mediaStats.aggregationInterval);
});
```

To dispose of the media statistics collector, invoke the `dispose` method of `mediaStatsCollector`.

```js
mediaStatsCollector.dispose();
```

To dispose of all collectors, invoke the `disposeAllCollectors` method of `mediaStatsApi`.

```js
mediaStatsFeature.disposeAllCollectors();
```
