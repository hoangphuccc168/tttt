### Pre-Registered Alpha IDs GA!

:::image type="content" source="./media/whats-new-images/10-23/geo-expansion-new.png" alt-text="A photograph of a map of the world showing multiple regions and a man pointing at one of them.":::

Alphanumeric Sender IDs is a one-way SMS messaging number type, formed by alphabetic and numeric characters that allow our customers to use their company name as sender of an SMS message providing improved brand recognition. Alphanumeric Sender IDs also support higher message throughput than toll-free and geographic numbers.
 
We're entering GA in five European regions that require preregistration to be able to use Alphanumeric Sender IDs: Norway, Finland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Czech Republic.
 

### Calling Web UI Library updates
:::image type="content" source="./media/whats-new-images/10-23/ui-library.png" alt-text="A graphic showing the elements of the Azure Communication Services UI Library.":::

The web version of our UI Library launched many new features this month, including:

#### Blur and custom backgrounds
We're excited to announce the general availability of blurred and custom backgrounds for desktop web within the Web UI SDK. These features make it easier for users to customize their video backgrounds and improve the overall video calling experience.

[Learn more about Custom Backgrounds](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/videoeffects--page)

#### Closed Captions in Interoperability
Closed captions are a textual representation of audio during a video conversation that is displayed to users in real-time. Closed captions are also a useful tool for end users who prefer to read the audio text in order to engage more actively in conversations and meetings. Closed captions also help in scenarios where end users might be in noisy environments or having difficulties with their audio equipment. Azure Communication Services collaboration with Teams offers developers the ability to integrate these closed captions into their applications.

[Learn more about how you can use Closed captions for your application](./concepts/interop/enable-closed-captions.md)

#### Interoperability Roles and Capabilities
Support for interoperability Microsoft Teams roles and capabilities is now in general availability. This feature enables users to control what features other users can have within a call. This signals the enabling of the Capabilities API within the Azure Communication Services Web UI Library. With the Capabilities API, users within Microsoft Teams interoperability calls can be assigned different roles that have different capabilities and access to different features. For example, a presenter might have the ability to share their screen, while a participant might only have the ability to view the presenter's screen.


[Learn more about Roles and Capabilities](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/capabilities--page)



#### Pinned Layouts and Rendering Options
Azure Communication Services UI library: Pinning and additional rendering options initially launched earlier in the year are now generally available. These features make it easier for developers to create responsive and flexible user interfaces.

[Learn more about Pinned Layouts](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/ui-components-videogallery--video-gallery#pinning-participants)

#### Raise Hands
The Raise Hand feature, introduced in April this year, is now generally available in both the Azure Communication Services calling SDK and the stable version of the UI Web SDK from version 1.18.0. The ability to raise hands in a meeting is a game-changer when in large virtual meetings where users can raise hands to keep order while asking questions, participate in Q&A sessions, request assistance, vote, bid farewell politely, or even signify your readiness to move forward—all without interrupting the flow of conversation. 

[Get started with Raise Hands](https://azure.github.io/communication-ui-library/?path=/docs/ui-components-controlbar-buttons-raisehand--raise-hand)




### Calling Native UI Library picture in picture (PIP)

With the new Picture in Picture (PiP) functionality, now in public preview, users can shrink the ongoing call into a small, draggable window. This feature allows for uninterrupted multitasking – whether you're browsing, checking notes, or using other apps, your call remains on-screen, ensuring you never miss a beat.

 

Another challenge many users faced in the past is the risk of breaking the call experience when switching between apps. The UI Library tackles this problem head-on. Now, users can easily go back to the same app or even switch to a different one without ever losing focus on the call. This means that if you're discussing a document on a call, you can seamlessly navigate to that document and back to the call, ensuring a fluid, integrated user experience.

Start using this feature in [Android](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library-android/releases/tag/calling-v1.5.0-beta.1) or [iOS](https://github.com/Azure/communication-ui-library-ios/releases/tag/AzureCommunicationUICalling_1.5.0-beta.1)

### Number Lookup
:::image type="content" source="./media/whats-new-images/10-23/number-lookup.png" lightbox="./media/whats-new-images/10-23/number-lookup-lightbox.png" alt-text="A diagram showing the number lookup architecture.":::

The Azure Communication Services public preview of the Number Lookup API is now available. This service enables developers with the necessary tools to integrate simple, highly accurate, and fast number lookup capabilities into their application. The API is designed to provide the highest quality possible, with data aggregated from reliable suppliers and updated regularly and it’s easy to use, with simple integration and detailed documentation to guide developers through the process.
