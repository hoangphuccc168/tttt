# Pull DICOM changes using the change feed

DICOM&reg; The change feed offers customers the ability to go through the history of the DICOM service and act on the create and delete events in the service. This how-to guide describes how to consume Change Feed.

The Change Feed is accessed using REST APIs. These APIs along with sample usage of Change Feed are documented in the [Overview of DICOM Change Feed](dicom-change-feed-overview.md). The version of the REST API should be explicitly specified in the request URL as called out in the [API Versioning for DICOM service Documentation](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

## Consume Change Feed

The following C# code example shows how to consume Change Feed using the DICOM client package.

```csharp
const int limit = 10;
 
using HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("<URL>") };
using CancellationTokenSource tokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
 
int read;
List<ChangeFeedEntry> entries = new List<ChangeFeedEntry>();
DicomWebClient client = new DicomWebClient(httpClient);
do
{
    read = 0;
    DicomWebAsyncEnumerableResponse<ChangeFeedEntry> result = await client.GetChangeFeed(
        $"?offset={entries.Count}&limit={limit}&includeMetadata={true}",
        tokenSource.Token);
 
    await foreach (ChangeFeedEntry entry in result)
    {
        read++;
        entries.Add(entry);
    }
} while (read > 0);
```
