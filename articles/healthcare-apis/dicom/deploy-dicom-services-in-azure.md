# Deploy the DICOM service

In this quickstart, you learn how to deploy the DICOM&reg; service by using the Azure portal.

After deployment is finished, you can use the Azure portal to go to the newly created DICOM service to see the details, including your service URL. The service URL to access your DICOM service is ```https://<workspacename-dicomservicename>.dicom.azurehealthcareapis.com```. Make sure to specify the version as part of the URL when you make requests. For more information, see [API versioning for the DICOM service](api-versioning-dicom-service.md).

## Prerequisites

To deploy the DICOM service, you need a workspace created in the Azure portal. For more information, see [Deploy a workspace in the Azure portal](../healthcare-apis-quickstart.md).

## Deploy the DICOM service

1. On the **Resource group** page of the Azure portal, select the name of your **Azure Health Data Services workspace**.

1. When you notice the green validation check mark, select **Create** to deploy the DICOM service.

1. After the deployment process is finished, select **Go to resource**.
