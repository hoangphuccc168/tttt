# Add and configure a catalog from GitHub or Azure DevOps in Azure Deployment Environments

Learn how to add and configure a [catalog](./concept-environments-key-concepts.md#catalogs) in your Azure Deployment Environments dev center. 

You can use a catalog to provide your development teams with a curated set of infrastructure as code (IaC) templates called [environment definitions](./concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environment-definitions). Your catalog is encrypted; Azure Deployment Environments supports encryption at rest with platform-managed encryption keys, which are managed by Microsoft for Azure Services.

Deployment Environments supports catalogs hosted in Azure Repos (the repository service in Azure, commonly referred to as Azure DevOps) and catalogs hosted in GitHub. Azure DevOps supports authentication by assigning permissions to a managed identity. Azure DevOps and GitHub both support the use of PATs for authentication. To further secure your templates, the catalog is encrypted; Azure Deployment Environments supports encryption at rest with platform-managed encryption keys, which Microsoft for Azure Services manages.

A catalog is a repository that's hosted in [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).

- To learn how to host a repository in GitHub, see [Get started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/get-started).
- To learn how to host a Git repository in an Azure DevOps project, see [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/repos/).

Microsoft offers a [sample catalog](https://aka.ms/deployment-environments/SampleCatalog) that you can use as your repository. You also can use your own private repository, or you can fork and customize the environment definitions in the sample catalog.

In this article, you learn how to:

> - Update a catalog.
> - Delete a catalog.

## Configure a managed identity for the dev center

After you create a dev center, before you can attach a catalog, you must configure a [managed identity](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#identities) to the dev center. You can attach either a system-assigned managed identity (system-assigned MSI) or a user-assigned managed identity (user-assigned MSI). You then assign roles to the managed identity to allow the dev center to create environment types in your subscription and read the Azure DevOps project that contains the catalog repo.

If your dev center doesn't have an MSI attached, follow the steps in this article to create and attach one: [Configure a managed identity](how-to-configure-managed-identity.md).


To learn more about managed identities, see: [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)

## Add a catalog

You can add a catalog from an Azure DevOps repository or a GitHub repository. You can choose to authenticate by assigning permissions to an MSI, also called a managed identity, or by using a PAT, which you store in a key vault.

Select the tab for the type of repository and authentication you want to use.

## [Azure DevOps repo with MSI](#tab/DevOpsRepoMSI/)

To add a catalog, you complete these tasks:

- Configure a managed identity for the dev center.
- Assign roles for the dev center managed identity.
- Assign permissions in Azure DevOps for the dev center managed identity.
- Add your repository as a catalog.

### Assign permissions in Azure DevOps for the dev center managed identity
You must give the dev center managed identity permissions to the repository in Azure DevOps.  

1. Sign in to your [Azure DevOps organization](https://dev.azure.com).

1. Select **Organization settings**.

## Add a catalog to the dev center
Azure Deployment Environments supports attaching Azure DevOps repositories and GitHub repositories. You can store a set of curated IaC templates in a repository. Attaching the repository to a dev center as a catalog gives your development teams access to the templates and enables them to quickly create consistent environments.

In this article, you attach an Azure DevOps repository.

### Add a catalog to your dev center
1. Navigate to your dev center.
1. In the left menu under **Environment configuration**, select **Catalogs**, and then select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-catalog/catalogs-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Catalogs pane.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-catalog/add-catalog-to-dev-center.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the add catalog pane with examples entries and Add highlighted.":::

1. In **Catalogs** for the dev center, verify that your catalog appears. If the connection is successful, **Status** is **Connected**. Connecting to a catalog can take a few minutes the first time.


## [Azure DevOps repo with PAT](#tab/DevOpsRepoPAT/)

To add a catalog, you complete these tasks:

- Get the clone URL for your repository.
- Create a personal access token.
- Store the personal access token as a key vault secret in Azure Key Vault.
- Add your repository as a catalog.

### Get the clone URL for your Azure DevOps repository

1. Go to the home page of your team collection (for example, `https://contoso-web-team.visualstudio.com`), and then select your project.
1. [Get the Azure Repos Git repo clone URL](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone#get-the-clone-url-of-an-azure-repos-git-repo).
1. Copy and save the URL. You use it later.
 
### Create a personal access token in Azure DevOps

1. Go to the home page of your team collection (for example, `https://contoso-web-team.visualstudio.com`) and select your project.
1. Create a [personal access token](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate#create-a-pat).
1. Save the generated token. You use the token later.

### Create a Key Vault
You need an Azure Key Vault to store the personal access token (PAT) that is used to grant Azure access to your repository. Key vaults can control access with either access policies or role-based access control (RBAC). If you have an existing key vault, you can use it, but you should check whether it uses access policies or RBAC assignments to control access. For help with configuring an access policy for a key vault, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?branch=main&tabs=azure-portal). 

Use the following steps to create an RBAC key vault:

1.	Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1.	In the Search box, enter *Key Vault*.
1.	From the results list, select **Key Vault**.
1.	On the Key Vault page, select **Create**.
1.	On the Create key vault tab, provide the following information:

    |Name      |Value      |
    |----------|-----------|
    |**Name**|Enter a name for the key vault.|
    |**Subscription**|Select the subscription in which you want to create the key vault.|
    |**Resource group**|Either use an existing resource group or select **Create new** and enter a name for the resource group.|
    |**Location**|Select the location or region where you want to create the key vault.|
    
    Leave the other options at their defaults.

1. On the Access policy tab, select **Azure role-based access control**, and then select **Review + create**.

1. On the Review + create tab, select **Create**.

### Store the personal access token in the key vault

1. In the Key Vault, on the left menu, select **Secrets**.
1.	On the Secrets page, select **Generate/Import**.
1.	On the Create a secret page:
    - In the **Name** box, enter a descriptive name for your secret.
    - In the **Secret value** box, paste the GitHub secret.
    - Select **Create**.

### Get the secret identifier

Get the path to the secret you created in the key vault. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your key vault.
1. On the key vault page, from the left menu, select **Secrets**.
1. On the Secrets page, select the secret you created earlier.
1. On the versions page, select the **CURRENT VERSION**.
1. On the current version page, for the **Secret identifier**, select copy.

### Add your repository as a catalog

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your dev center.
1. Ensure that the [identity](./how-to-configure-managed-identity.md) that's attached to the dev center has [access to the key vault secret](./how-to-configure-managed-identity.md#grant-the-managed-identity-access-to-the-key-vault-secret) where your personal access token is stored.
1. In the left menu under **Environment configuration**, select **Catalogs**, and then select **Add**.
1. In **Add catalog**, enter the following information, and then select **Add**:

    | Field | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |
    | **Name** | Enter a name for the catalog. |
    | **Catalog location**  | Select **Azure DevOps**. |
    | **Authentication type** | Select **Personal Access Token**.|
    | **Organization**  | Select the organization that hosts the catalog repo. |
    | **Project**  | Select the project that stores the catalog repo.|
    | **Rep**  | Select the repo that stores the catalog.|
    | **Folder path** | Select the folder that holds your IaC templates.|
    | **Secret identifier**| Enter the secret identifier that contains your personal access token for the repository.<br /> When you copy a secret identifier, the connection string includes a version identifier at the end, like in this example: `https://contoso-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/GitHub-repo-pat/9376b432b72441a1b9e795695708ea5a`.<br />Removing the version identifier ensures that Deployment Environments fetch the latest version of the secret from the key vault. If your personal access token expires, only the key vault needs to be updated. <br />*Example secret identifier:* `https://contoso-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/GitHub-repo-pat`|

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-catalog/add-devops-catalog-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add a catalog to a dev center.":::

    |**Repository access**|Select **Public Repositories (read-only)**.|
    
    Leave the other options at their defaults.
1. Select **Generate token**.
1. Save the generated token. You use the token later.


### Create a Key Vault
You need an Azure Key Vault to store the personal access token (PAT) that is used to grant Azure access to your repository. Key vaults can control access with either access policies or role-based access control (RBAC). If you have an existing key vault, you can use it, but you should check whether it uses access policies or RBAC assignments to control access. For help with configuring an access policy for a key vault, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?branch=main&tabs=azure-portal).

    - Select **Create**.


### Get the secret identifier

Get the path to the secret you created in the key vault. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your key vault.
1. On the key vault page, from the left menu, select **Secrets**.
1. On the Secrets page, select the secret you created earlier.
1. On the versions page, select the **CURRENT VERSION**.
1. On the current version page, for the **Secret identifier**, select copy.

### Add your repository as a catalog

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your dev center.
1. Ensure that the [identity](./how-to-configure-managed-identity.md) that's attached to the dev center has [access to the key vault secret](./how-to-configure-managed-identity.md#grant-the-managed-identity-access-to-the-key-vault-secret) where your personal access token is stored.
1. In the left menu under **Environment configuration**, select **Catalogs**, and then select **Add**.
1. In **Add catalog**, enter the following information, and then select **Add**:

    | Field | Value |
    | ----- | ----- |

If your personal access token expires, only the key vault needs to be updated. <br />*Example secret identifier:* `https://contoso-kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/GitHub-repo-pat`|

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-configure-catalog/add-github-catalog-pane.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to add a catalog to a dev center." lightbox="media/how-to-configure-catalog/add-github-catalog-pane.png":::

1. In **Catalogs** for the dev center, verify that your catalog appears. If the connection is successful, **Status** is **Connected**.

---

## Update a catalog

If you update the Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) contents or definition in the attached repository, you can provide the latest set of environment definitions to your development teams by syncing the catalog.

To sync an updated catalog in Azure Deployment Environments:

1. On the left menu for your dev center, under **Environment configuration**, select **Catalogs**,
1. Select the specific catalog, and then select **Sync**. The service scans through the repository and makes the latest list of environment definitions available to all the associated projects in the dev center.

## Delete a catalog

You can delete a catalog to remove it from the Azure Deployment Environments dev center. Templates in a deleted catalog aren't available to development teams when they deploy new environments. Update the environment definition reference for any existing environments that were created by using the environment definitions in the deleted catalog. If the reference isn't updated and the environment is redeployed, the deployment fails.

To delete a catalog:

1. On the left menu for your dev center, under **Environment configuration**, select **Catalogs**.
1. Select the specific catalog, and then select **Delete**.
1. In the **Delete catalog** dialog, select **Continue** to delete the catalog.

## Catalog sync errors

When you add or sync a catalog, you might encounter a sync error. A sync error indicates that some or all the environment definitions have errors. Use the Azure CLI or the REST API to GET the catalog. The GET response shows you the type of errors:

- Ignored environment definitions that were detected to be duplicates.
- Invalid environment definitions that failed due to schema, reference, or validation errors.

### Resolve ignored environment definition errors

An ignored environment definition error occurs if you add two or more environment definitions that have the same name. You can resolve this issue by renaming environment definitions so that each environment definition has a unique name within the catalog.

### Resolve invalid environment definition errors

An invalid environment definition error might occur for various reasons:

- **Manifest schema errors**. Ensure that your environment definition manifest matches the [required schema](configure-environment-definition.md#add-an-environment-definition).

- **Validation errors**. Check the following items to resolve validation errors:

  - Ensure that the manifest's engine type is correctly configured as `ARM`.
  - Ensure that the environment definition name is between 3 and 63 characters.
  - Ensure that the environment definition name includes only characters that are valid for a URL, which are alphanumeric characters and these symbols: `~` `!` `,` `.` `'` `;` `:` `=` `-` `_` `+` `(` `)` `*` `&` `$` `@`
  
- **Reference errors**. Ensure that the template path that the manifest references is a valid relative path to a file in the repository.
