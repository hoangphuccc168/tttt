> [!WARNING]
> Support for MLflow Projects (`MLproject` files) in Azure Machine Learning will be fully retired in September 2026. MLflow is still fully supported, and is still the recommended way to track machine learning workloads in Azure Machine Learning.
>
> As you continue to use MLflow, we recommend that you transition from `MLproject` files to Azure Machine Learning __Jobs__, using either the Azure CLI or the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python (v2). For more information on Azure Machine Learning jobs, see [Track ML experiments and models with MLflow](../how-to-use-mlflow-cli-runs.md#configuring-the-experiment).
