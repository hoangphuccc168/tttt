# Customize environment for runtime (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prompt flow is currently in public preview. This preview is provided without a service-level agreement, and are not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

## Customize environment with docker context for runtime

This section assumes you have knowledge of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Azure Machine Learning environments](../concept-environments.md).

### Step-1: Prepare the docker context

#### Create `image_build` folder

In your local environment, create a folder contains following files, the folder structure should look like this:

```
|--image_build
|  |--requirements.txt
|  |--Dockerfile
|  |--environment.yaml
```

#### Define your required packages in `requirements.txt`

**Optional**: Add packages in private pypi repository.

Using the following command to download your packages to local: `pip wheel <package_name> --index-url=<private pypi> --wheel-dir <local path to save packages>`

Open the `requirements.txt` file and add your extra packages and specific version in it.  For example:

```
###### Requirements with Version Specifiers ######
langchain == 0.0.149        # Version Matching. Must be version 0.6.1
keyring >= 4.1.1            # Minimum version 4.1.1
coverage != 3.5             # Version Exclusion. Anything except version 3.5
Mopidy-Dirble ~= 1.1        # Compatible release. Same as >= 1.1, == 1.*
```

You can obtain the path of local packages using `ls > requirements.txt`.

#### Define the `Dockerfile`

Create a `Dockerfile` and add the following content, then save the file:

```
FROM <Base_image>
COPY ./* ./
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!NOTE]
> This docker image should be built from prompt flow base image that is `mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/promptflow/promptflow-runtime-stable:<newest_version>`. If possible use the [latest version of the base image](https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/azureml/promptflow/promptflow-runtime/tags/list). 

### Step 2: Create custom Azure Machine Learning environment 

#### Define your environment in `environment.yaml`

In your local compute, you can use the CLI (v2) to create a customized environment based on your docker image.

> [!NOTE]
> - Make sure to meet the [prerequisites](../how-to-manage-environments-v2.md#prerequisites) for creating environment.
> - Ensure you have [connected to your workspace](../how-to-manage-environments-v2.md?#connect-to-the-workspace).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prompt flow is **not supported** in the workspace which has data isolation enabled. The enableDataIsolation flag can only be set at the workspace creation phase and can't be updated.
>
>Prompt flow is **not supported** in the project workspace which was created with a workspace hub. The workspace hub is a private preview feature.

```shell
az login(optional)
az account set --subscription <subscription ID>
az configure --defaults workspace=<Azure Machine Learning workspace name> group=<resource group>
```

Open the `environment.yaml` file and add the following content. Replace the <environment_name> placeholder with your desired environment name.

```yaml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/environment.schema.json
name: <environment_name>
build:
  path: .
```

#### Run CLI command to create an environment

```bash
cd image_build
az login(optional)
az ml environment create -f environment.yaml --subscription <sub-id> -g <resource-group> -w <workspace>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Building the image may take several minutes.

Go to your workspace UI page, then go to the **environment** page, and locate the custom environment you created. You can now use it to create a runtime in your Prompt flow. To learn more, see [Create compute instance runtime in UI](how-to-create-manage-runtime.md#create-compute-instance-runtime-in-ui).

To learn more about environment CLI, see [Manage environments](../how-to-manage-environments-v2.md#manage-environments).

## Create a custom application on compute instance that can be used as Prompt flow runtime

A prompt flow runtime is a custom application that runs on a compute instance. You can create a custom application on a compute instance and then use it as a Prompt flow runtime. To create a custom application for this purpose, you need to specify the following properties:

| UI             | SDK                         | Note                                                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Docker image   | ImageSettings.reference     | Image used to build this custom application                                    |
| Target port    | EndpointsSettings.target    | Port where you want to access the application, the port inside the container   |
| published port | EndpointsSettings.published | Port where your application is running in the image, the publicly exposed port |

### Create custom application as Prompt flow runtime via SDK v2

```python
# import required libraries
import os
from azure.ai.ml import MLClient
from azure.ai.ml.entities import WorkspaceConnection
# Import required libraries
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, InteractiveBrowserCredential

try:
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    # Check if given credential can get token successfully.
    credential.get_token("https://management.azure.com/.default")
except Exception as ex:
    # Fall back to InteractiveBrowserCredential in case DefaultAzureCredential not work
    credential = InteractiveBrowserCredential()

from azure.ai.ml.entities import ComputeInstance 
from azure.ai.ml.entities import CustomApplications, ImageSettings, EndpointsSettings, VolumeSettings 

ml_client = MLClient.from_config(credential=credential)

image = ImageSettings(reference='mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/promptflow/promptflow-runtime-stable:<newest_version>') 

endpoints = [EndpointsSettings(published=8081, target=8080)]

app = CustomApplications(name='promptflow-runtime',endpoints=endpoints,bind_mounts=[],image=image,environment_variables={}) 

ci_basic_name = "<compute_instance_name>"

ci_basic = ComputeInstance(name=ci_basic_name, size="<instance_type>",custom_applications=[app]) 

ml_client.begin_create_or_update(ci_basic)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Change `newest_version`, `compute_instance_name` and `instance_type` to your own value.

### Create custom application as Prompt flow runtime via Azure Resource Manager template

You can use this Azure Resource Manager template to create compute instance with custom application.
