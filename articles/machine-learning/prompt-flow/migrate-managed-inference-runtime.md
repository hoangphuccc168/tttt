# Deprecation plan for managed online endpoint/deployment runtime

Managed online endpoint/deployment as runtime is deprecated. We recommend you migrate to compute instance or serverless runtime.

From **September 2013**, we'll stop the creation for managed online endpoint/deployment as runtime, the existing runtime will still be supported until **November 2023**.

## Migrate to compute instance runtime

If the existing managed online endpoint/deployment runtime is used by yourself and you didn't share with other users, you can migrate to compute instance runtime.

- Create compute instance yourself or ask the workspace admin to create one for you. To learn more, see [Create and manage an Azure Machine Learning compute instance](../how-to-create-compute-instance.md).
- Using the compute instance to create a runtime. You can reuse the custom environment of the existing managed online endpoint/deployment runtime. To learn more, see [Customize environment for runtime](how-to-customize-environment-runtime.md).
