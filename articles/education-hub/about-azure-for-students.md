# What is Azure for Students?

[Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) is a program offered by Microsoft Azure to provide students at Higher Education Institutions with access to various Azure cloud services and resources. Joining Azure for Students will grant you $100 in Azure credits with no credit card required. This credit will be valid for one year and you can renew each year you're an active student to get an addition $100. You also receive access to a set of free services you can deploy once you join. Select versions of Azure Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Databases, Azure Blob Storage and more are all free with your subscription.

## Prerequisites

Azure for Students is available only to students who meet the following requirements: 
* You must affirm that you're age 18 or older and attend an accredited, degree-granting, two-year or four-year educational institution where you’re a full-time student. 
* You must verify your academic status through your institution’s email address. 
* See the Azure for Students Offer for detailed terms of use. 
* This offer isn't available for use in a massive open online course (MOOC) or in other professional trainings from for-profit organizations. 

This offer is limited to one Azure for Student subscription per eligible customer. It's nontransferable and can't be combined with any other offer, unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.

## Next steps

You need to verify yourself as an active student to become eligible for the offer. This verification process takes place as part of the signup flow for Azure for Students here.
